Obviously, your \\nindividual goals differ from those of your \\nfellow classmates, but everyone’s goals \\nshare one common attribute: their \\nintention to improve individual wellbeing. \\nHowever, there are as many ideas about \\nhow to do that as there are individuals. Do \\nyour goals involve making more money, \\nachieving better health, improving your \\nrelationships? Holistic wellness involves all \\nthose aspects of life and more. This chapter \\nexplains the importance of overall wellness, \\nwhich is about more than being physically \\nand mentally healthy, free from illness and \\ndisease. In fact, the study of wellness \\nincorporates all aspects of life. Achieving \\noverall wellness means living actively and \\nfully. People in this state exude confidence, \\noptimism, and self-efficacy; they have the \\nenergy reserves to do what needs to be \\ndone today and to plan for a better \\ntomorrow. The most effective and \\ntransformative goals are those designed to \\nachieve the highest level of personal \\nwellness.  \\n \\n \\nDimensions of Wellness \\n \\nWellness is a familiar term, but what is its \\ntrue definition? Is it simply the absence of \\ndisease? This chapter will define all the \\ncomponents of holistic wellness and \\ndescribe the factors that contribute to not \\nonly a person’s physical and mental health, \\nbut also their ability to develop, thrive, \\nsucceed, enjoy life, and meet challenges \\nhead on with confidence and resolve.  \\n \\nTo achieve this type of overall wellness, a \\nperson must be healthy in nine \\ninterconnected dimensions of wellness: \\nphysical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, \\nsocial, environmental, occupational, \\nfinancial, and cultural. A description of each \\ndimension follows. \\n \\n \\nThe Nine Dimensions of Wellness \\n \\n• Physical Wellness \\nPeople who are physically well \\nactively make healthy decisions on a \\ndaily basis.

This section will explore how changes \\nto behavior occur, the psychological \\nbarriers that hamper efforts to change, and \\ntips for making lasting change. \\n \\n \\nHow Changes in Behavior Occur \\n \\nThe Transtheoretical Model, also called the \\nStages of Change Model, was developed by \\nJames Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente in \\nthe late 1970s. Considered the dominant \\nmodel for describing how behavior changes \\noccur, it evolved through studies examining \\nthe experiences of smokers who quit on \\ntheir own and comparing them with the \\nexperiences of those requiring further \\ntreatment. The goal of those studies was to \\nunderstand why some people were capable \\nof quitting on their own. It was determined \\nthat people quit smoking if they were ready \\nto do so. Thus, the Transtheoretical Model \\n(TTM) focuses on the decision-making of \\nthe individual and is a model of intentional \\nchange. The TTM operates on the \\nassumption that people do not change \\nbehaviors quickly and decisively. Rather, \\nchange in behavior, especially habitual \\nbehavior, occurs continuously through a \\ncyclical process. The TTM is not a theory but \\na model; different behavioral theories and \\nconstructs can be applied to various stages \\nof the model where they may be most \\neffective. \\n \\nThe TTM posits that individuals move \\nthrough six stages of change: \\nprecontemplation, contemplation, \\npreparation, action, maintenance, and \\ntermination. Termination was not part of \\nthe original model and is less often used in \\napplication of stages of change for health-\\nrelated behaviors. For each stage of change, \\ndifferent intervention strategies are most \\neffective at moving the person to the next \\nstage of change and subsequently through \\nthe model to maintenance, the ideal stage \\nof behavior. \\n \\nSix Stages of Change: \\n \\n• Stage 1: Precontemplation \\nIn this stage, people do not intend \\nto take action in the foreseeable \\nfuture (defined as within the next 6 \\nmonths). People are often unaware \\nthat their behavior is problematic or \\nproduces negative consequences. \\nPeople in this stage often \\nunderestimate the pros of changing \\nbehavior and place too much \\nemphasis on the cons of changing \\nbehavior.'),\n",

You have tried before—\\nprobably declaring another attempt as a \\nNew Year’s resolution—but without \\nexperiencing much success. Making a \\nlifestyle change is challenging, especially \\nwhen you want to transform many things at \\nonce. This time, think of those changes not \\nas a resolution but as an evolution. \\n \\nLifestyle changes are a process that take \\ntime and require support. Once you are \\nready to make a change, the difficult part is \\ncommitting and following through. So do \\nyour research and make a plan that will \\nprepare you for success. Careful planning \\nmeans setting small goals and taking things \\none step at a time. \\nHere are five tips from the American \\nPsychological Association (APA) that will \\nassist you in making lasting, positive \\nlifestyle and behavior changes: \\n \\n• Make a plan that will stick. \\nYour plan is a map that will guide \\nyou on this journey of change. You \\ncan even think of it as an adventure. \\nWhen making your plan, be specific. \\nWant to exercise more? Detail the \\ntime of day when you can take walks \\nand how long you will walk. Write \\neverything down, and ask yourself if \\nyou are confident that these \\nactivities and goals are realistic for \\nyou. If not, start with smaller steps. \\nPost your plan where you will most \\noften see it as a reminder. \\n \\n• Start small. \\nAfter you've identified realistic \\nshort-term and long-term goals, \\nbreak down your goals into small, \\nmanageable steps that are \\nspecifically defined and can be \\nmeasured. Is your long-term goal to \\nlose 20 pounds within the next five \\nmonths? A good weekly goal would \\nbe to lose one pound a week. If you \\nwould like to eat healthier, consider \\nas a goal for the week replacing \\ndessert with a healthier option, like \\nfruit or yogurt. At the end of the \\nweek, you will feel successful \\nknowing you met your goal. \\n \\n• Change one behavior at a time. \\nUnhealthy behaviors develop over \\nthe course of time, so replacing \\nunhealthy behaviors with healthy \\nones requires time.

Our Paleolithic \\nancestors regularly engaged in physical activity \\nto survive. However, rather than chasing after a \\nsoccer ball to win a game or taking a leisurely \\nstroll down a tree-lined path, they “worked out” \\nby chasing after their next meal. For them, no \\nexercise meant no food. How’s that for a health \\nbenefit? \\nWith the advent of sedentary agriculture some \\n10,000 years ago, that same level of peak \\nperformance was no longer necessary. As our \\nancestors continued to devise more advanced \\nmeans of acquiring food, physical activity \\ndeclined. It wasn’t until the fourth century BCE, \\nthat the Greek physician Herodicus, recognized \\nthe importance of being physically active \\noutside of a hunter-gatherer society. He \\npracticed gymnastic medicine, a branch of \\nGreek medicine that relied on vigorous exercise \\nas a treatment. During that same time period, \\nHippocrates, who is often referred to as the \\nFather of Modern Medicine, asserted, “If we \\ncould give every individual the right amount of \\nnourishment and exercise, not too little and not \\ntoo much, we would have found the safest way \\nto health.”  In the 12 century CE, the Jewish \\nphilosopher Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, a \\nphysician to the Sultan of Egypt, stated, \\n”Anyone who lives a sedentary life and does not \\nexercise, even if he eats good foods and takes \\ncare of himself according to proper medical \\nprinciples, all his days will be painful ones and \\nhis strength will wane.”\\n  The 15th century \\ntheologian and scholar Robert Burton went so \\nfar as to declare that not exercising, or \\n“idleness” as he referred to it in his widely read \\ntome, The Anatomy of Melancholy, was the \\n“bane of body and mind.” Burton also warned \\nthat the lack of exercise was the sole cause of \\nmelancholy (the name given depression at that \\ntime) and “many other maladies.” Burton \\nclaimed that idleness was one of the seven \\ndeadly, as well as “the nurse of naughtiness,” \\nand the “chief author of mischief.” For Burton, \\nexercise was not only essential for good health, \\nbut a means of avoiding eternal damnation.  \\n  \\nBy the 16th century, the benefits of exercise \\nwere widely accepted, at least among the \\nwealthy and the educated, who had access to \\nleisure. During this time period, H. Mercuralis \\ndefined exercise as “the deliberate and planned \\nmovement of the human frame, accompanied \\nby breathlessness, and undertaken for the sake \\nof health or fitness.” This definition is still \\nwidely used today.  \\n \\nBeyond the physical health benefits, there are \\naffective benefits associated with group games'),\n",

Ancient Mayans organized the \\nfirst team game called the Ball Game. It \\nconsisted of two teams trying to get a ball \\nthrough a hoop mounted approximately 23 feet \\non a wall.

In \\nsome cases the captain of the losing team gave \\nhimself as a human sacrifice to the winning \\nteam, an act that was believed by the Mayans \\nto be a vital part of prosperity.  \\nAmerican Indians are thought to have founded \\nthe modern game of lacrosse, as well as other \\nstick games.

As such, game \\nvenues and equipment were prepared \\nritualistically.  \\nFrom Ancient History to Modern \\nTimes \\nIn retrospect, the perceived benefits of exercise \\nhave changed very little since Herodicus or the \\nAmerican Indians. Mounting research supports \\nhistorical assertions that exercise is vital to \\nsustaining health and quality of life.  Culturally, \\nsports play a huge role in growth and \\ndevelopment of youth and adults.

Exercise also reduces risk for chronic \\ndiseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity. \\nRegular exercise can even improve emotional \\nhealth and overall wellbeing.  \\nWhat are Physical Activity \\nand Exercise? \\n \\nPhysical activity is defined as any movement \\ncarried out by skeletal muscle that requires \\nenergy and is focused on building health. Health \\nbenefits include improved blood pressure, \\nblood-lipid profile, and heart health. Acceptable \\nphysical activity includes yard work, house \\ncleaning, walking the dog, or taking the stairs \\ninstead of the elevator. Physical activity does \\nnot have to be done all it once. It can be \\naccumulated through various activities \\nthroughout the day. Although typing on a \\nphone or laptop or playing video games does \\ninvolve skeletal muscle and requires a minimal \\namount of energy, the amount required is not \\nsufficient to improve health.  \\n \\nDespite the common knowledge that physical \\nactivity is tremendously beneficial to one’s \\nhealth, rates of activity among Americans \\ncontinue to be below what is needed. According \\nto the Center for Disease Control (CDC), only 1 \\nin 5 (21%) of American adults meet the \\nrecommended physical activity guidelines from \\nthe Surgeon General. Less than 3 in 10 high \\nschool students get 60 minutes or more of \\nphysical activity per day. Non-Hispanic whites \\n(26%) are more active than their Hispanic (16%) \\nand Black counterparts (18%) as is the case for \\nmales (54%) and females (46%).

Exercise is a planned, structured, and \\nrepetitive movement pattern intended to \\nimprove fitness. As a positive side-effect, it \\nsignificantly improves health as well. Fitness \\nimprovements include the heart’s ability to \\npump blood, increased muscle size, and \\nimproved flexibility.  \\nComponents of Health-Related \\nFitness \\n \\nIn order to carry out daily activities without \\nbeing physically overwhelmed, a minimal level \\nof fitness is required. To perform daily activities \\nwithout fatigue, it is necessary to maintain \\nhealth in five areas: cardiorespiratory \\nendurance, muscular strength and endurance, \\nflexibility, and body composition. These five \\nareas are called the components of health-\\nrelated fitness. Development of these areas will \\nimprove your quality of life, reduce your risk of \\nchronic disease, and optimize your health and \\nwell-being. Each of these 5 areas will be \\nexplored in depth at a later time. Below is a \\nbrief description of each. \\n \\n• Cardiorespiratory endurance \\nCardiorespiratory endurance is the \\nability to carry out prolonged, large \\nmuscle, dynamic movements at a \\nmoderate to high level of intensity. This \\nrelates to your heart’s ability to pump \\nblood and your lungs’ ability to take in \\noxygen.  \\n• Muscular strength \\nMuscular strength is the ability of the \\nmuscles to exert force over a single or \\nmaximal effort.  \\n \\n• Muscular endurance \\nMuscular endurance is the ability to \\nexert a force over a period of time or \\nrepetitions.  \\n \\n• Flexibility \\nFlexibility is the ability to move your \\njoints through a full range of motion.  \\n \\n• Body Composition \\nBody composition is the relative \\namount of fat mass to fat-free mass.  \\n \\nAs previously stated, these areas are significant \\nin that they influence your quality of life and \\noverall health and wellness.  \\n \\nSkill-Related Components of Fitness \\n \\nIn addition to the 5 health-related components, \\nthere are 6 skill-related components that assist \\nin developing optimal fitness: speed, agility, \\ncoordination, balance, power, and reaction \\ntime. Although important, these areas do not \\ndirectly affect a person’s health. A person’s \\nability to perform ladder drills (also known as \\nagility drills) is not related to his/her heart \\nhealth. However, coordination of muscle \\nmovements may be helpful in developing \\nmuscular strength through resistance training.  \\nAs such, they may indirectly affect the 5 areas \\nassociated with health-related fitness. Skill-\\nrelated components are more often associated \\nwith sports performance and skill development.  \\n \\n \\nPrinciples of Adaptation to \\nStress \\n \\nThe human body adapts well when exposed \\nto stress. The term stress, within the \\ncontext of exercise, is defined as an \\nexertion above the normal, everyday \\nfunctioning. The specific activities that \\nresult in stress vary for each individual and \\ndepend on a person’s level of fitness. For \\nexample, a secretary who sits at a desk all \\nday may push his/her cardiorespiratory \\nsystem to its limits simply by walking up'),\n",

For an avid runner, \\nresistance training may expose the runner’s \\nmuscles to muscular contractions the \\nathlete is not accustomed to feeling. \\nAlthough stress is relative to each \\nindividual, there are guiding principles in \\nexercise that can help individuals manage \\nhow much stress they experience to avoid \\ninjury and optimize their body’s capacity to \\nadapt. Knowing a little about these \\nprinciples provides valuable insights needed \\nfor organizing an effective fitness plan.   \\n \\n \\nOverload Principle \\n \\nConsider the old saying, “No pain, no gain.” \\nDoes exercise really have to be painful, as \\nthis adage implies, to be beneficial? \\nAbsolutely not. If that were true, exercise \\nwould be a lot less enjoyable. Perhaps a \\nbetter way to relay the same message \\nwould be to say that improvements are \\ndriven by stress. Physical stress, such as \\nwalking at a brisk pace or jogging, places \\nincreased stress on the regulatory systems \\nthat manage increased heart rate and blood \\npressure, increased energy production, \\nincreased breathing, and even increased \\nsweating for temperature regulation. As \\nthese subsequent adaptations occur, the \\nstress previously experienced during the \\nsame activity, feels less stressful in future \\nsessions. As a result of the adaptation, \\nmore stress must be applied to the system \\nin order to stimulate improvements, a \\nprinciple known as the overload principle.   \\n \\nFor example, a beginning weightlifter \\nperforms squats with 10 repetitions at 150 \\npounds. After 2 weeks of lifting this weight, \\nthe lifter notices the 150 pounds feels \\neasier during the lift and afterwards causes \\nless fatigue. The lifter adds 20 pounds and \\ncontinues with the newly established stress \\nof 170 pounds. The lifter will continue to \\nget stronger until his/her maximum \\ncapacity has been reached, or the stress \\nstays the same, at which point the lifter’s \\nstrength will simply plateau. This same \\nprinciple can be applied, not only to gain \\nmuscular strength, but also to gain \\nflexibility, muscular endurance, and \\ncardiorespiratory endurance.  \\n \\nFITT \\n \\nIn exercise, the amount of stress placed on \\nthe body can be controlled by four \\nvariables: Frequency, Intensity, Time \\n(duration), and Type, better known as FITT. \\nThe FITT principle, as outlined by the \\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine \\n(ACSM) falls under the larger principle of \\noverload.  \\n \\n \\nFrequency and Time \\n \\nEach variable can be used independently or \\nin combination with other variables to \\nimpose new stress and stimulate \\nadaptation. Such is the case for frequency \\nand time. \\n  \\nFrequency relates to how often exercises \\nare performed over a period of time. In \\nmost cases, the number of walking or \\njogging sessions would be determined over \\nthe course of a week. A beginner may \\ndetermine that 2–3 exercise sessions a \\nweek are sufficient enough to stimulate \\nimprovements. On the other hand, a \\nseasoned veteran may find that 2–3 days is \\nnot enough to adequately stress the \\nsystem. According to the overload principle, \\nas fitness improves, so must the stress to'),\n",

Certainly, a \\n30-minute brisk walk is less stressful on the \\nbody than a 4-hour marathon.  \\n \\nAlthough independent of one another, \\nfrequency and time are often combined \\ninto the blanket term, volume. The idea is \\nthat volume more accurately reflects the \\namount of stress experienced. This can be \\nconnected to the progression principle. For \\nexample, when attempting to create a \\njogging plan, you may organize 2 weeks like \\nthis:  \\n \\n• Week 1: three days a week at 30 \\nminutes per session \\n• Week 2: four days a week at 45 \\nminutes per session \\n \\nAt first glance, this might appear to be a \\ngood progression of frequency and time. \\nHowever, when calculated in terms of \\nvolume, the aggressive nature of the \\nprogression is revealed. In week 1, three \\ndays at 30 minutes per session equals 90 \\nminutes of total exercise. In week two, this \\namount was doubled with four days at 45 \\nminutes, equaling 180 minutes of total \\nexercise.

Other activities \\nthat accomplish the same objective include \\nswimming, biking, dancing, cross country \\nskiing, aerobic classes, and much more. As \\nsuch, these activities can be used to build \\nlung capacity and improve cellular and \\nheart function. \\n \\nHowever, the more specific the exercise, \\nthe better. While vigorous ballroom dancing \\nwill certainly help develop the \\ncardiorespiratory system, it will unlikely \\nimprove a person’s 10k time. To improve \\nperformance in a 10k, athletes spend the \\nmajority of their time training by running, \\nas they will have to do in the actual 10k. \\nCyclists training for the Tour de France, \\nspend up to six hours a day in the saddle, \\npeddling feverishly. These athletes know \\nthe importance of training the way they \\nwant their body to adapt. This concept, \\ncalled the principle of specificity, should be \\ntaken into consideration when creating a \\ntraining plan.   \\n \\nIn this discussion of type and the principle \\nof specificity, a few additional items should \\nbe considered. Stress, as it relates to \\nexercise, is very specific. There are multiple \\ntypes of stress. The three main stressors are \\nmetabolic stress, force stress, and \\nenvironmental stress. Keep in mind, the \\nbody will adapt based on the type of stress \\nbeing placed on it.  \\n \\nMetabolic stress results from exercise \\nsessions when the energy systems of the \\nbody are taxed. For example, sprinting short \\ndistances requires near maximum intensity'),\n",

Anaerobic energy production \\ncan only be supported for a very limited \\ntime (10 seconds to 2 minutes). However, \\ndistance running at steady paces requires \\naerobic energy production, which can last \\nfor hours. As a result, the training strategy \\nfor the distance runner must be different \\nthan the training plan of a sprinter, so the \\nenergy systems will adequately adapt.  \\n \\nLikewise, force stress accounts for the \\namount of force required during an activity. \\nIn weightlifting, significant force production \\nis required to lift heavy loads. The type of \\nmuscles being developed, fast-twitch \\nmuscle fibers, must be recruited to support \\nthe activity. In walking and jogging, the \\nforces being absorbed come from the body \\nweight combined with forward momentum. \\nSlow twitch fibers, which are unable to \\ngenerate as much force as the fast twitch \\nfibers, are the type of muscle fibers \\nprimarily recruited in this activity. Because \\nthe force requirements differ, the training \\nstrategies must also vary to develop the \\nright kind of musculature.  \\n \\nEnvironmental stress, such as exercising in \\nthe heat, places a tremendous amount of \\nstress on the thermoregulatory systems. As \\nan adaptation to the heat, the amount of \\nsweating increases as does plasma volume, \\nmaking it much easier to keep the body at a \\nnormal temperature during exercise. The \\nonly way to adapt is through heat exposure, \\nwhich can take days to weeks to properly \\nadapt.  \\n \\nIn summary, to improve performance, being \\nspecific in your training, or training the way \\nyou want to adapt, is paramount.  \\n \\n \\nIntensity \\n \\nIntensity, the degree of difficulty at which \\nthe exercise is carried out, is the most \\nimportant variable of FITT. More than any \\nof the other components, intensity drives \\nadaptation. Because of its importance, it is \\nimperative for those beginning a fitness \\nprogram to quantify intensity, as opposed \\nto estimating it as hard, easy, or \\nsomewhere in between. Not only will this \\nnumeric value provide a better \\nunderstanding of the effort level during the \\nexercise session, but it will also help in \\ndesigning sessions that accommodate \\nindividual goals.  \\n \\nHow then can intensity be measured? Heart \\nrate is one of the best ways to measure a \\nperson’s effort level for cardiorespiratory \\nfitness.  Using a percentage of maximum \\nlifting capacity would be the measure used \\nfor resistance training.  \\n \\n \\nRest, Recovery, and Periodization \\n \\nFor hundreds of years, athletes have been \\nchallenged to balance their exercise efforts \\nwith performance improvements and \\nadequate rest. The principle of rest and \\nrecovery (or principle of recuperation) \\nsuggests that rest and recovery from the \\nstress of exercise must take place in \\nproportionate amounts to avoid too much \\nstress.

This training \\nprinciple, called periodization, is especially \\nimportant to serious athletes but can be \\napplied to most exercise plans as well. The \\nprinciple of periodization suggests that \\ntraining plans incorporate phases of stress \\nfollowed by phases of rest.  \\n \\nTraining phases can be organized on a daily, \\nweekly, monthly, and even multi-annual \\ncycles, called micro-, meso-, and \\nmacrocycles, respectively. An example of \\nthis might be: \\n \\nWeek Frequency Intensity Time Type \\n1 3 days 40% HRR 25 min walk \\n2 4 days 40% HRR 30 min walk \\n3 4 days 50% HRR 35 min walk \\n4 2 days 30% HRR 30 min other \\n \\nAs this table shows, the volume and \\nintensity changes from week 1 to week 3. \\nBut, in week 4, the volume and intensity \\ndrops significantly to accommodate a \\ndesignated rest week. If the chart were \\ncontinued, weeks 5-7 would be “stress” \\nweeks and week 8 would be another rest \\nweek. This pattern could be followed for \\nseveral months.  \\n \\nWithout periodization, the stress from \\nexercise would continue indefinitely \\neventually leading to fatigue, possible \\ninjury, and even a condition known as \\novertraining syndrome. Overtraining \\nsyndrome is not well understood. However, \\nexperts agree that a decline in performance \\nresulting from psychological and \\nphysiological factors cannot be fixed by a \\nfew days’ rest. Instead, weeks, months, and \\nsometimes even years are required to \\novercome the symptoms of overtraining \\nsyndrome. Symptoms include the following: \\n \\n• weight loss  \\n• loss of motivation \\n• inability to concentrate or focus \\n• feelings of depression \\n• lack of enjoyment in activities \\nnormally considered enjoyable \\n• sleep disturbances \\n• change in appetite \\n \\n \\nReversibility \\n \\nChronic adaptations are not permanent. As \\nthe saying goes, “Use it or lose it.”  \\nThe principle of reversibility suggests that \\nactivity must continue at the same level to \\nkeep the same level of adaptation. As \\nactivity declines, called detraining, \\nadaptations will recede.  \\n \\nIn cardiorespiratory endurance, key areas, \\nsuch as VO\\n2max, stroke volume, and cardiac \\noutput all declined with detraining while \\nsubmaximal heat rate increased. In one \\nstudy, trained subjects were given bed rest \\nfor 20 days. At the end of the bed rest \\nphase, VO\\n2max had fallen by 27% and stroke \\nvolume and cardiac output had fallen by \\n25%.

Begin with \\nthis knowledge in mind and be \\npatient as you work through the \\nchallenges of making exercise a \\nconsistent part of your life.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Start out slowly. \\nAgain, you are in this for the long \\nhaul. No need to overdo it in the \\nfirst week. Plan for low intensity \\nactivity, for 2–3 days per week, and \\nfor realistic periods of time (20–30 \\nminutes per session).  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Begin with low Intensity/low volume. \\nAs fitness improves, you will want to \\ngradually increase your efforts in \\nterms of quantity and quality. You \\ncan do this with more time and \\nfrequency (called volume) or you \\ncan increase your intensity. In \\nbeginning a program, do not change \\nboth at the same time.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Keep track. \\nResults from a program often occur \\nslowly, subtly, and in a very anti-\\nclimactic way. As a result,'),\n",

If these objectives \\ncould be compromised by going for a run at \\nnoon in 95-degree heat, or lifting large \\namounts of weight without a spotter, you \\nshould reconsider your plan.

A 2013 \\nreport released by the Center for Disease \\nControl stated that about 658 deaths from \\nheat-related illnesses occurred every year \\nwhich account for more deaths than \\ntornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning \\ncombined. Of those deaths, most were \\nmale, older adults.8 \\n \\nThe number one risk factor associated with \\nheat-related illness is hydration, the starting \\npoint of all heat-related illness. \\nUnfortunately, sweat loss can occur at a \\nfaster rate than a person can replace with \\nfluids during exercise, especially at high \\nintensities. Even when trying to hydrate, \\ningestion of large amounts of fluids during \\nexercise can lead to stomach discomfort. \\nWhat does this mean? Hydration must \\nbegin before exercise and must become \\npart of your daily routine.  \\nSeveral practical methods of monitoring \\nhydration levels can assist in preventing \\nillness. One simple method, while not full \\nproof, is to simply monitor the color of your \\nurine. In a hydrated state, urination will \\noccur frequently (every 2–3 hours) and \\nurine will have very little color. In a \\ndehydrated state, urination occurs \\ninfrequently in low volume and will become \\nmore yellow in color.  \\nAnother simple method involves weighing \\nyourself before and after a workout (see \\nlab). This is a great way to see firsthand \\nhow much water weight is lost during an \\nexercise session primarily as a result of \\nsweat. Your goal is to maintain your pre- \\nand post-body weight by drinking fluids \\nduring and after the workout to restore'),\n",

This method, when \\ncombined with urine-monitoring, can \\nprovide a fairly accurate assessment of \\nhydration levels.   \\nThe best preventative measure for \\nmaintaining a hydrated state is simply \\ndrinking plenty of water throughout the \\nday. In previous years, recommendations \\nfor the amount of water to drink were a \\none size fits all of about 48–64 oz. per day, \\nper person. In an effort to individualize \\nhydration, experts now recommend basing \\nfluid intake on individual size, gender, \\nactivity levels, and climate. Generally, half \\nan ounce (fluid ounces) to 1 ounce per \\npound of body weight is recommended.\\n9 \\nFor a 150-pound individual, this would \\nmean 75–150 ounces of water per day! \\nWhile there is still considerable debate over \\nthe exact amounts, no one disputes the \\nimportance of continually monitoring your \\nhydration using one of the techniques \\ndescribed previously. Insufficient hydration \\nleads to poor performance, poor health, \\nand potentially serious illness.  \\nIt should be noted that electrolyte “sport” \\ndrinks, such as Gatorade and PowerAde, are \\noften used to maintain hydration. While \\nthey can be effective, these types of drinks \\nwere designed to replace electrolytes \\n(potassium, sodium, chloride) that are lost \\nthrough sweating during physical activity. In \\naddition, they contain carbohydrates to \\nassist in maintaining energy during activities \\nof long duration. If the activity planned is \\nshorter than 60 minutes in duration, water \\nis still the recommended fluid. For activities \\nbeyond 60 minutes, a sports drink should \\nbe used.  \\n \\n \\nCold-Related Illnesses \\n \\nMuch like extremely hot environmental \\nconditions, cold weather can create \\nconditions equally as dangerous if you fail \\nto take proper precautions. To minimize the \\nrisk of cold-related illness, you must \\nprevent the loss of too much body heat. \\nThe three major concerns related to cold-\\nrelated illnesses are hypothermia, frost-nip, \\nand frost bite.  \\n \\nAs with heat-related illness, the objective of \\npreventing cold-related illness is to \\nmaintain the proper body temperature of \\nbetween 98.6 and 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit. \\nIf body temperature falls below 98.6 F, \\nmultiple symptoms may appear, indicating \\nthe need to take action. Some of those \\nsymptoms include: \\n• shivering \\n• numbness and stiffness of joints and \\nappendages \\n• loss of dexterity and/or poor \\ncoordination \\n• peeling or blistering of skin, \\nespecially to exposed areas \\n• discoloration of the skin in the \\nextremities \\nWhen walking or jogging in the cold, it is \\nimportant to take the necessary steps to \\navoid problems that can arise from the \\nenvironmental conditions.  \\n• Hydration is key. \\nCold air is usually drier air, which \\nleads to moisture loss through \\nbreathing and evaporation.

Both oxygen and \\nnutrients, which are imperative for cellular \\nenergy production, must be taken in from \\nthe lungs and digestive system. Because the \\nheart and lungs are so interlocked in this \\nprocess, the two systems are often labeled \\ntogether as the cardiorespiratory system. \\nWithout a healthy respiratory system, the \\nbody would struggle to bring in enough \\noxygen, release carbon dioxide (the \\nchemical waste product of cellular \\nmetabolism) and eliminate unwanted \\nparticles that enter the respiratory tract \\nwhen inhaling. Without a healthy heart, \\ntransporting oxygen from the lungs and \\nnutrients from the digestive system to the \\nbody’s cells would be impossible. If the \\nhealth of the CR system were compromised \\nenough, survival would be impossible. \\nAdditionally, both must be healthy or the \\nfunction of one or the other will be \\ncompromised.  \\n \\nBelow are several videos explaining how the \\ncardiovascular and respiratory systems \\noperate and function together: \\n \\n• The CR System and Exercise\\n \\n \\n• How the Cardiovascular System \\nWorks \\n \\n• Respiratory System Explained in \\nDetail \\n \\n \\nThe CR System and Energy \\nProduction \\n \\nClearly the cardiovascular and respiratory \\nsystems function as one, but why is the CR \\nsystem so important? What makes the \\ndistribution of oxygen throughout the body \\nso vital to existence? The answer is simple: \\nENERGY. While oxygen in and of itself does \\nnot contain any energy (calories), it does \\ncombine with fuel extracted from food once \\nit has been introduced into the cell to help \\nproduce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP \\nis the basic form of cellular energy found in \\nthe body. Because the body stores very \\nlittle ATP, it must constantly be \\nregenerated. For this reason, people must \\ncontinue eating and breathing to live.  \\n \\nWithin the context of fitness, the purpose \\nof the cardiorespiratory system is not only \\nto produce energy but to also adapt in a \\nway so that energy production can be \\noptimized. For example, a high school cross \\ncountry runner wants to be fit enough to \\ncompete in the state cross country meet. \\nUnfortunately, this athlete’s current mile \\ntimes are 6 minutes per mile. In other \\nwords, that is the maximum work rate \\npossible for this athlete. However, the goal \\nis to improve to 5 minutes per mile, or \\nimprove the maximum work rate.

An example of this \\nadaptation comes from the world record \\nmile time of 3 minutes and 43 seconds. The \\nworld record marathon time (26.2 miles) is \\n2 hours, 2 minutes, and 52 seconds.

That is some \\nserious ATP production! \\n \\n \\nOxidative Energy System \\n(Aerobic) \\n \\nAs oxygen and nutrients are delivered to \\nthe cells, they are utilized to produce ATP. \\nThe workhorses of the cell for oxidative \\nmetabolism are the mitochondria. This \\nform of energy production is contingent on \\nthe ability of the CR system to deliver \\noxygen and nutrients and the cell’s ability to \\nprocess that oxygen. Because of the \\nimportance of oxygen in this particular \\nenergy-producing pathway, it is called the \\noxidative energy system, or aerobic system.  \\n \\nOxidative energy production is the primary \\nmeans of ATP production during rest and \\nfor activities that last for 2 minutes or \\nlonger. Although other forms of energy \\nproduction assist in ATP production at any \\ngiven time, long duration exercise sessions \\nrely on this aerobic pathway.

Each of the \\nwalking/jogging assessments discussed here \\nattempts to estimate a key physiological \\nmarker of the heart’s and lungs’ functioning \\ncapacity and maximal oxygen consumption. \\nMaximal oxygen consumption, or VO2 max, \\nmeasures the body’s maximum ability to \\ntake in and utilize oxygen, which directly \\ncorrelates to overall health and fitness. A \\ngood estimate of VO\\n2 max provides a one-\\ntime glance at a person’s health and fitness \\nlevel and a baseline measurement for \\nreassessment at future dates to gauge \\nimprovements.  \\n \\nSome of the most common walking/jogging \\nassessments used to estimate VO2 max \\ninclude the 12-Minute Walk, 1.5-Mile \\nRun/Walk Test, 3-Minute Step Test, and 1-\\nMile Walk Test. Unfortunately, these field \\nassessments, although practical and \\ninexpensive, only provide estimations. \\nMore accurate assessments require a lab-\\nbased VO2max test using equipment that \\nmeasures the volume of oxygen and carbon \\ndioxide being moved in and out of the air \\npassages during exercise. Although this test \\nis more accurate, the expense and \\navailability make it impractical for most. \\nUnlike the lab test, the field assessments \\nare relatively cost free, user-friendly and \\nrequire very little expertise to conduct or \\nperform. In addition, the key point of the \\nassessment is measuring differences rather \\nthan absolute values, and the field tests \\naccurately meet that objective.  \\nInformation on how to safely perform these \\nassessments will be provided at the end of \\nthis chapter.  \\n \\n \\nMeasuring Heart Rate \\n \\nThose starting the VO\\n2max assessments must \\nfirst measure their heart rate, an important  \\ncomponent used in the calculations.  \\n \\nHere is a video describing how to determine \\nheart rate: \\n \\n• How to check your pulse\\n \\n \\n \\nCreating a Plan to Develop \\nCR Fitness \\n \\nOnce the assessments have been \\ncompleted, the next step is to develop a \\nplan for maintaining or improving your \\ncurrent level of fitness.

So how do you \\nknow if you are in the right range?  \\n \\nHeart rate is one of the best ways to \\nmeasure effort level. Walking and jogging \\nincrease a person’s heart rate. Based on the \\nfunction of the heart, this is no surprise. \\nThe heart rate directly correlates with the \\namount of oxygen being taken in by the \\nlungs.

Heart rate zones \\nrepresent an intensity range—a low end \\nheart rate and a high end rate—within \\nwhich a person’s heart rate would fall \\nduring a walking or jogging session.  \\n \\nThe first step in determining your target \\nheart rate (THR), is to determine your \\nmaximum heart rate (MHR), both \\nmeasured in beats per minute (bpm). \\nGenerally, MHR is estimated to be your age \\nsubtracted from 220 beats per minute.

The \\nmethod is as simple as asking the question, \\nOverall, how hard do I feel I am working? \\nThe answer is given based on a scale of 6 to \\n20 with 6 being almost no effort and 20 \\nbeing maximum effort. Studies have \\nindicated that when subjects are asked to \\nexercise at a moderate or heavy intensity \\nlevel, subjects can accurately do so, even \\nwithout seeing their heart rate. As a result, \\nusing the RPE scale can be an effective way \\nof managing intensity.  \\n \\nThe original RPE scale or Borg Scale, \\ndesigned by Dr. Gunnar Borg, was \\ndeveloped to mimic generalized heart rate \\npatterns. The starting and ending point of \\nthe scale are less intuitive than a typical \\nscale of 1-10. By design, the 6 represents a \\nresting heart rate of 60 bpm and the 20 an \\nexercise heart rate of 200 bpm, a beat \\ncount someone might experience at \\nmaximum effort. Over time, a modified \\nBorg Scale was developed using a simple 1–\\n10 scale, with 1 being resting effort and 10 \\nbeing maximum effort. Even though the \\nmodified scale is more intuitive, the \\ntraditional scale is still used more \\nfrequently.  \\n \\nWalking and jogging not only benefit \\nphysical health, but many enjoy the social \\nbenefits realized by exercising with friends. \\nWhen walking or jogging with friends, \\nintensity can easily be measured by \\nmonitoring your ability to carry on a \\nconversation. With the Talk Test, if you are \\nonly able to say short phrases or give one \\nword responses when attempting to \\nconverse during an exercise session, this \\nwould suggest you are working at a high \\nenough intensity that your breathing rate \\nmakes conversation difficult. Certainly, if \\nyou can speak in full sentences without \\ngetting winded, the intensity would be very \\nlight.

A muscle is \\nmade up of many muscle fasciculi, which \\nare surrounded by a thick collagenous layer \\nof connective tissue called the epimysium.  \\nThe epimysium covers the whole surface of \\nthe muscle. \\n \\nMuscle fibers also contain many \\nmitochondria, which are energy \\npowerhouses that are responsible for the \\naerobic production of energy molecules, or \\nATP molecules. Muscle fibers also contain \\nglycogen granules as a stored energy \\nsource, and myofibrils, which are threadlike \\nstructures running the length of the muscle \\nfiber. Myofibrils are made up of two types \\nof protein: 1) Actin myofilaments, and \\n2) myosin myofilaments. The actin and \\nmyosin filaments form the contractile part \\nof the muscle, which is called \\nthe sarcomere. Myosin filaments are thick \\nand dark when compared with actin \\nfilaments, which are much thinner and \\nlighter in appearance. The actin and myosin \\nfilaments lie on top of one another; it is this \\narrangement of the filaments that gives \\nmuscle its striated or striped appearance. \\nWhen groups of actin and myosin filaments \\nare bound together by connective tissue \\nthey make the myofibrils. When groups of \\nmyofibrils are bound together by \\nconnective tissue, they make up muscle \\nfibers. \\n \\nThe ends of the muscle connect to bone \\nthrough a tendon. The muscle is connected \\nto two bones in order to allow movement \\nto occur through a joint. When a muscle \\ncontracts, only one of these bones will \\nmove. The point where the muscle is \\nattached to a bone that moves is called \\nthe insertion. The point where the muscle is \\nattached to a bone that remains in a fixed \\nposition is called the origin.'),\n",

During this process the actin \\nand myosin filaments do not change length \\nwhen muscles contract, but instead they \\nslide past each other. \\n \\nDuring this process the muscle fiber \\nbecomes shorter and fatter in appearance. \\nAs a number of muscle fibers shorten at the \\nsame time, the whole muscle contracts and \\ncauses the tendon to pull on the bone it \\nattaches to. This creates movement that \\noccurs at the point of insertion. \\n \\nFor the muscle to return to normal (i.e., to \\nlengthen), a force must be applied to the \\nmuscle to cause the muscle fibers to \\nlengthen. This force can be due to gravity or \\ndue to the contraction of an opposing \\nmuscle group.  \\n \\nSkeletal muscles contract in response to an \\nelectric signal called an action potential. \\nAction potentials are conducted along \\nnerve cells before reaching the muscle \\nfibers. The nerve cells regulate the function \\nof skeletal muscles by controlling the \\nnumber of action potentials that are \\nproduced. The action potentials trigger a \\nseries of chemical reactions that result in \\nthe contraction of a muscle. \\n \\nWhen a nerve impulse stimulates a motor \\nunit within a muscle, all of the muscle fibers \\ncontrolled by that motor unit will contract. \\nWhen stimulated, these muscle fibers \\ncontract on an all-or-nothing basis. The all-\\nor-nothing principle means that muscle \\nfibers either contract maximally along their \\nlength or not at all. Therefore, when \\nstimulated, muscle fibers contract to their \\nmaximum level and when not stimulated \\nthere is no contraction. In this way, the \\nforce generated by a muscle is not \\nregulated by the level of contraction by \\nindividual fibers, but rather it is due to the \\nnumber of muscle fibers that are recruited \\nto contract. This is called muscle fiber \\nrecruitment. When lifting a light object, \\nsuch as a book, only a small number of \\nmuscle fibers will be recruited. However, \\nthose that are recruited will contract to \\ntheir maximum level. When lifting a heavier \\nweight, many more muscle fibers will be \\nrecruited to contract maximally. \\n \\nWhen one muscle contracts, another \\nopposing muscle will relax. In this way, \\nmuscles are arranged in pairs. An example \\nis when you bend your arm at the elbow: \\nyou contract your bicep muscle and relax \\nyour tricep muscle. This is the same for \\nevery movement in the body. There will \\nalways be one contracting muscle and one \\nrelaxing muscle. If you take a moment to \\nthink about these simple movements, it will \\nsoon become obvious that unless the \\nopposing muscle is relaxed, it will have a \\nnegative effect on the force generated by \\nthe contracting muscle.  \\n \\nA muscle that contracts, and is the main \\nmuscle group responsible for the \\nmovement, is called the agonist or prime \\nmover. The muscle that relaxes is called \\nthe antagonist. One of the effects that \\nregular strength training has is an \\nimprovement in the level of relaxation that \\noccurs in the opposing muscle group. \\nAlthough the agonist/antagonist \\nrelationship changes, depending on which'),\n",

They are also smaller, have \\nbetter blood supply, contract more slowly, \\nand are more fatigue resistant than their \\nfast-twitch brothers. Slow-twitch muscle \\nfibers produce energy, primarily, through \\naerobic metabolism of fats and \\ncarbohydrates. The accelerated rate of \\naerobic metabolism is enhanced by the \\nlarge numbers of mitochondria and the \\nenhanced blood supply. They also contain \\nlarge amounts of myoglobin, a pigment \\nsimilar to hemoglobin that also stores \\noxygen. The myoglobin provides an \\nadditional store of oxygen for when oxygen \\nsupply is limited.

Using these \\nforms of resistance alone, in combination \\nwith one another, or in combination with \\nthe more traditional resistance apparatus, \\ncan enable you to diversify your efforts to \\nproduce valuable and improved results.  \\n \\nIn each type of training, you may use an \\napparatus to create an environment for \\nresistance. The uniqueness of these sources \\nis found in the way they are implemented. \\nYou might use a dumbbell for a particular \\nexercise in some of these alternative \\nresistance methods, but the way you use \\nthe resistance through a range of motion \\nmay be altogether different.  \\n \\n• Dynamic Constant Training  \\nAs the name suggests, the most \\ndistinctive feature of dynamic \\nconstant training (DCT) is that the \\nresistance is constant. A good \\nexample of DCT occurs when you \\nuse free weights or machines that \\ndo not alter resistance, but redirect \\nit instead. The emphasis shifts to \\ndifferent planes along the muscle \\ngroup being worked. When you \\nwork on a shoulder-press machine, \\nfor example, the resistance remains \\nconstant over the entire range of \\nmotion. It is identical from the \\nbottom of the movement to the top \\nand back down again. Only the \\ndirection of the resistance varies. \\nThe resistance redirects itself \\nthrough the arc and then redirects \\nitself again when the shoulders let \\nthe weight come back down to the \\nstarting position.  \\n \\n• Dynamic Progressive Training \\nIn dynamic progressive training \\n(DPT), resistance increases \\nprogressively as you continue to \\nexercise. DPT is often used as a \\nrehabilitative measure and offers \\nthe sort of resistance that builds \\ngradually while remaining \\ncompletely within the control of the \\nperson using it.

Whereas DCT \\nemploys constant resistance, never \\nvarying to accommodate the body's \\nmechanics, DVT can be adapted to \\nthe varying degrees of strength of a \\nmuscle group throughout a range of \\nmotion.

The muscle neither \\nlengthens nor shortens. You may be \\nwondering how any training occurs \\nwithout lengthening and shortening \\nthe muscles.

Flexibility relates to \\nthe ability to move a joint through its full \\nrange of motion (ROM). Developing a \\ncomplete fitness program requires taking \\ntime to emphasize this component by \\nstretching. Unfortunately, as the American \\nCouncil on Exercise points out, “Most \\npeople neglect flexibility training, limiting \\nfreedom of movement, physical and mental \\nrelaxation, release of muscle tension and \\nsoreness, and injury prevention.”\\n1 \\n \\nPerhaps the reason it is so easy for people \\nto overlook flexibility is because its benefits, \\nwhile significant, are felt more than seen. \\nHowever, failing to address this component \\nof fitness can have serious consequences, \\nespecially as a person ages. Without \\nflexibility, everyday tasks, such as sweeping \\nthe floor or even getting out of bed, \\nbecome difficult. A reduced mobility of \\njoints increases the risk of injury during an \\nexercise routine, as well as the risk of \\noccasional and chronic back pain. This \\nchapter will provide a greater \\nunderstanding of this vitally important \\ncomponent of a complete fitness program \\nand demonstrate why flexibility shouldn’t \\nbe overlooked.  \\n \\nTypes of Flexibility \\n \\nFlexibility is classified into two types: static \\nand dynamic.  \\n \\n• Static flexibility \\nThis type of flexibility is a measure \\nof the limits of a joint’s overall range \\nof motion. It is measured by \\nstretching and holding a joint in the \\nposition of its maximum range while \\nusing a measuring instrument to \\nquantify that range. To achieve the \\nmaximum range, passive forces, the \\nforce generated from an external \\nsource, are required.  \\n \\n• Dynamic flexibility \\nThis type of flexibility is a measure \\nof overall joint stiffness during \\nmovement. Unlike static flexibility, \\ndynamic flexibility requires active \\nforce production, or your own \\nmuscles contracting. Because \\nquantifying “stiffness,” is difficult, \\ndynamic flexibility is measured more \\nsubjectively. Assessment is based on'),\n",

That number \\nincreases dramatically with age, and \\nwomen are more likely to develop joint \\nsymptoms.2 For adults, arthritis is one of \\nthe most common conditions, with 54% of \\npeople 75 years and older having been \\ndiagnosed with arthritis.\\n3 Regular exercise, \\nincluding regular stretching, is essential for \\npeople with arthritis to maintain function \\nand manage joint pain. Even for those not \\naffected by joint conditions, stretching \\nincreases joint mobility and function, and \\ndecreases joint stiffness and pain.  \\n \\nImbalances in the muscles can cause \\ndiscomfort and pain. For example, if the \\nfront of a person’s thighs and hips gets too \\ntight from a lack of flexibility, the tension \\nwill pull on the hips, where the muscles are \\nattached. The result is the pelvis may be \\npulled forward and cause greater sway in \\nyour lower back. This affects posture and \\ncan eventually lead to pain and stiffness in \\nthe neck, shoulders, and lower back. \\nStretching all major muscle groups and joint \\nareas regularly promotes good alignment \\nand balance.  \\n \\n \\nMuscle Relaxation and Stress Relief  \\n \\nStaying in one position for long periods of \\ntime, repetitive movements, and other \\neveryday stressors can result in stiff \\nmuscles and knots, also called trigger \\npoints. Regular stretching decreases \\nanxiety, blood pressure, and breathing rate, \\nwhich help to relax muscles and aches and \\npains related to neuromuscular tension \\n(stress). Flexibility has also been prescribed \\nsuccessfully to treat dysmenorrhea, which is \\npainful menstruation.

Therefore, flexibility is \\ncritical in maintaining a high quality of life \\nthroughout the aging process.  \\n \\n \\nThe Inactivity -Mobility Cycle  \\n \\nAnyone who has suffered an injury and had \\nto wear a splint, cast, or brace to \\nimmobilize a joint knows how important \\nmobility is to overall health. Unfortunately, \\nwhen the joints’ ROM becomes restricted \\nby arthritis or other injuries, activity \\ndeclines. As activity declines, the ROM \\ncontinues to diminish as a result of \\ninactivity, and a vicious cycle ensues. A \\nsimple stretching program can help \\nalleviate this problem and break the cycle.   \\n \\n \\nImproving Range of Motion  \\n \\nJoint ROM results from a combination of \\nfactors, which are classified as either \\ninternal or external. Internal structures \\nrelate to the physical structures of body \\nmaterials and tissue. External factors are \\nnon-structural and include gender, age, \\nexcess fat mass, muscle mass, \\nenvironmental temperature, and \\nrestrictions in clothing or equipment.  \\n \\nInternal factors include joint structure/joint \\nmechanics and the connective and soft \\ntissue surrounding the joint.

This \\nresistance to the stretch, called the \\nmyotatic or stretch reflex is generated by \\nthe nervous system’s reflexive stimulus sent \\nto the stretching muscle. That same signal \\nalso causes the antagonist, or opposing \\nmuscle to relax, called reciprocal inhibition. \\nAs such, when the upper thigh (quadriceps) \\nare stretched, the hamstrings (antagonist to \\nthe quadriceps) relax.  \\n \\nThe GTOs are located near the \\nmusculotendon junction, the end points of \\nthe muscle, and relay messages to the \\ncentral nervous system regarding muscle \\nlengthening and tension of the muscle. \\nWhen activated, these signals will override \\nthe stretch reflex causing a sudden \\nrelaxation of the stretching muscle.

Instructions on how to perform \\nthese assessments will follow later.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSetting Goals \\n \\nOnce you determine which of your joints \\nare the most and least flexible, you can set \\nsome realistic goals to improve or maintain \\nyour ROM. Be specific when you set goals. \\nInstead of just saying, “I want to increase \\nmy flexibility,” identify the specific area of \\nthe body you intend to improve. You will \\nalso want to make sure your goal can be \\nmeasured. A better way to state your goal \\nis, “I will improve my sit-and-reach score by \\n4 cm by the end of the semester.” Notice \\nthis goal, as stated, includes a specific area, \\nis measurable, and includes a deadline. By \\nstating your goal properly, you will increase \\nthe likelihood of achieving it.  \\n \\n \\nApplying the FITT Principle  \\n \\nAs mentioned previously, the ACSM has \\nmade recommendations for designing a \\nflexibility program based on the FITT \\nPrinciple (Frequency, Intensity, Time and \\nType). As the ACSM recommends, your \\nflexibility program should include multiple \\nstretching exercises that target all major \\njoints, including the neck, shoulders, \\nelbows, wrists, trunk, hips, knees, and \\nankles. \\n \\n \\nAfter selecting your exercises, follow the \\nrecommendations below when performing \\nyour routine: \\n  \\n• Frequency  \\nStretch a minimum of 2-3 days per \\nweek, ideally 5-7 days per week.'),\n",

The two primary sensors related to \\nflexibility are Golgi Tendon Organs (GTO’s) \\nand muscle spindles.  \\n \\nJoint Structure: the fixed arrangement of a \\njoint that is a determining factor for range \\nof motion. An example would be ball-in-\\nsocket joint or modified hinge joint.  \\n \\nMyotatic Reflex: a reflexive stimulus of the \\nmuscle to contract as a muscle is being \\nstretched.  \\n \\nReciprocal Inhibition: the principle that \\nwhen one muscle is stimulated to contract \\nthe opposing muscle is will relax.  \\n \\nAutogenic Inhibition: an inhibitory reflex \\nthat allows one sensor in the muscle to \\noverride the signals of another sensor.

Surface fat, located just \\nbelow the skin, is called subcutaneous fat. \\nFat that lies deeper in the body surrounding \\nthe body’s organs is called visceral fat. \\nUnlike subcutaneous fat, visceral fat is more \\noften associated with abdominal fat. \\nResearchers have found that excessive belly \\nfat decreases insulin sensitivity, making it \\neasier to develop type II diabetes. It may \\nalso negatively impact blood lipid \\nmetabolism, contributing to more cases of \\ncardiovascular disease and stroke in \\npatients with excessive belly fat.\\n8  \\n \\nBody fat distribution can easily be \\ndetermined by simply looking in the mirror. \\nThe outline of the body, or body shape, \\nwould indicate the location of where body \\nfat is stored. Abdominal fat storage patterns \\nare generally compared to the shape of an \\napple, called the android shape. This shape \\nis more commonly found in males and post-\\nmenopausal females. In terms of disease \\nrisk, this implies males and post-\\nmenopausal females are at greater risk of \\ndeveloping health issues associated with \\nexcessive visceral fat. Individuals who \\nexperience chronic stress tend to store fat \\nin the abdominal region.  \\n \\nA pear-shaped body fat distribution pattern, \\nor gynoid shape, is more commonly found \\nin pre-menopausal females. Gynoid shape is \\ncharacterized by fat storage in the lower \\nbody such as the hips and buttocks. This \\nshape may be connected to females’ child-\\nbearing abilities as enzymes associated with \\nfat-storage and mobilization are activated \\nduring certain times of pregnancy and post-\\npartum.  \\n \\nBesides looking in the mirror to determine \\nbody shape, people can use an inexpensive \\ntape measure to measure the diameter of \\ntheir hips and waist. Many leading \\norganizations and experts currently believe \\na waist circumference of 40 or greater for \\nmales and 35 or greater for females \\nsignificantly increases risk of disease.\\n9  \\n \\nIn addition to measuring waist \\ncircumference, measuring the waist and the \\nhips and using a waist-to-hip ratio (waist \\ncircumference divided by the hip \\ncircumference) is equally effective at \\npredicting body fat-related health \\noutcomes.

As \\nage increases, muscle mass declines. \\nSeniors who have experienced years of \\nmuscle mass decline but increased body fat \\nmay maintain a constant weight despite \\nhaving a very different body composition.  \\n \\nOther criticisms of using BMI as a health risk \\nassessment tool include its failure to take \\nage or gender into account. As discussed \\npreviously, females naturally have more \\nbody fat yet are classified in the same \\ncontext as males. Because this \\nmeasurement is so widely used by \\nphysicians, patients continue to express \\nconcerns about the validity of BMI as an \\nindication of fatness.  \\n \\nRegardless of the criticisms, BMI as used for \\nthe general population, has been shown to \\nbe a reasonable predictor of health \\noutcomes. At its core, it is not intended to \\nbe an estimate of body composition, i.e., \\nmeasure FM and FFM. Instead, it is \\nintended to be used as an estimate of \\nhealthy/unhealthy levels of body fat. When \\nused as a means of tracking weight changes \\nover time it can be a valuable tool in \\npredicting health and for recommending \\nlifestyle modifications.\\n11  \\n \\n \\nHow to Measure Body \\nComposition \\n \\nMultiple methods exist to estimate body \\ncomposition. Remember, body composition \\nis the ration of FM and FFM used to help \\ndetermine health risks. Of the other \\nmethods already mentioned (waist, waist-\\nto-hip ratio, and BMI), none provide \\nestimates of body composition but do \\nprovide measurements of other weight-\\nrelated health markers, such as abdominal \\nfat. Experts have designed several methods \\nto estimate body composition. While they \\nare not flawless, they do provide a fairly \\naccurate representation of body \\ncomposition. The most common are:  \\n \\n• Hydrostatic Weighing (Underwater \\nWeighing) \\nAt one time, hydrostatic weighing \\n(also and maybe more accurately \\ncalled hydrodensitometry) was \\nconsidered the criterion for \\nmeasuring body composition. Many \\nother methods are founded on this \\nmodel, in one form or another. This \\nmethod attempts to measure the \\ndensity of the body by applying \\nArchimedes’ principle:  \\nBMI ='),\n",

The mass \\nand volume components are \\nmeasured by using dry weight and \\nthen weight while being submerged \\nin a water tank. Since fat is less \\ndense than muscle tissue, a person \\nwith more body fat will weigh less in \\nthe water than a similar person with \\nmore lean mass. Using the \\nmeasurements, the density can be \\ndetermined and converted into body \\nfat percentage. With a small margin \\nof error (around 1-2%) this method \\nis very accurate. Unfortunately, the \\nexpense and practicality of building \\nand maintaining a water tank limits \\naccess for most. Also, for those with \\na fear of water, this would obviously \\nnot be the preferred method.  \\n \\n• Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry \\n(DEXA) \\nReplacing underwater weighing as \\nthe new “gold standard,” is DEXA. \\nWhile underwater weighing \\naccurately compartmentalizes FM \\nand FFM, DEXA adds a third \\ncompartment by using low-radiation \\nX-rays to distinguish bone mineral. \\nThis addition slightly increases the \\naccuracy of DEXA by eliminating \\nsome of the guess work associated \\nwith individual differences, such as \\ntotal body water and bone mineral \\ndensity.  \\n \\nOriginally, DEXA scanners were \\ndesigned to determine and help \\ndiagnose bone density diseases. As a \\nresult, they can be found in many \\nphysicians’ offices. However, a full \\nbody scan, which takes only a few \\nminutes, is all that is needed to also \\ndetermine body fat percentage.  \\n \\nMajor disadvantages to this method \\nare its high cost and the need for a \\nwell-trained professional to operate \\nthe equipment and analyze the \\nresults.  \\n \\n• Air Displacement (Plethysmography) \\nA good alternative to more \\nexpensive methods, air \\ndisplacement determines body \\ndensity using the same principle as \\nunderwater weighing, by measuring \\nmass and volume. Clearly, the main \\ndifference is that mass and volume \\nare being determined by air \\ndisplacement rather than water \\ndisplacement. Using a commercial \\ndevice (the Bod Pod is most \\ncommonly referenced), a person sits \\nin a chamber that varies the air \\npressure allowing for body volume \\nto be assessed. Air displacement \\nprovides a viable alternative for \\nthose with a fear of water.  \\n \\nLike many other methods, the \\nexpense, availability, and training of \\npersonnel Air Displacement requires \\nlimit accessibility. Additionally, its \\naccuracy is slightly less than \\nunderwater weighing.  \\n \\n• Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis \\n(BIA) \\nBIA takes a slightly different \\napproach to measuring FFM. The \\npremise behind BIA is that FFM will \\nbe proportional to the electrical \\nconductivity of the body.

Compiling \\nmultiple measurements and analyzing them \\nprovides a better idea of a person’s current \\nhealth status and will help determine the \\nnext course of action. For example, BMI \\nalone can be beneficial.

Where \\nweight loss is needed, the plan should \\ninclude a balance of calorie restriction and \\nphysical activity/exercise. This might also \\ninclude tracking your current eating and \\nactivity habits. More specific information on \\nweight management strategies will be \\ndiscussed in a later chapter.  \\n \\n \\nLow Body Composition \\n \\nBecause more people experience excess \\nbody fat, the focus up to this point has been \\non health concerns related to overweight \\nand obesity. However, fat is an essential \\ncomponent to a healthy body, and in rare \\ncases, individuals have insufficient fat \\nreserves, which can also be a health \\nconcern. The range of essential body fat for \\nmales is 3-5% and 8-12% for females. \\nAttempting to, or intentionally staying in \\nthose ranges, through excessive exercise or \\ncalorie restriction is not recommended. \\nUnfortunately, low body fat is often \\nassociated with individuals struggling with \\neating disorders, the majority of whom are \\nfemales.  \\n \\nThe main concern of low body fat relates to \\nthe number and quality of calories being \\nconsumed.

However, \\nwhen they use the term stress, they rarely \\nknow its true meaning. The word carries \\nmany negative connotations and is \\nassociated with an unpleasant or traumatic \\nevent. As such, people mistakenly believe \\nthat stress is simply the nervousness and \\ntension experienced prior to, during, or \\nafter a negative event. In fact, the effects of \\nstress are physiological, emotional, and \\npsychological.  \\n \\n \\nAdditionally, not all levels of stress are \\ndetrimental. The stress athletes experience \\nright before a big game or college students \\nfeel right before an exam can enhance \\nfocus and increase their ability to \\nconcentrate. Stress is either good or bad \\ndepending on how long it persists and how \\nit is perceived by the individual.  \\n \\nThis chapter will provide a deeper \\nunderstanding of what stress is and provide \\neffective strategies for managing stress.  \\n \\n \\nWhat Is Stress and How \\nDoes It Affect W ellness?  \\n \\nStress is defined as the body’s physical, \\nmental, and emotional response to a \\nparticular stimulus, called a stressor. This \\nadaption/coping-response helps the body \\nprepare for challenging situations. It is the \\nlevel of a person’s response to a stressor \\nthat determines whether the experience is \\npositive or negative. As a hardworking \\ncollege student, you may feel as if you know \\nthe meaning of stress all too well.

The good news is, not all \\nstress is bad! Small levels of stress can \\nenhance cognitive brain function. Stress \\nmay provide the motivation and \\nconcentration you need to write an essay, \\npractice a speech, or prepare for a job \\ninterview. For most people, these types of \\nstressors are manageable and not harmful. \\nStressors that have the potential for harm \\ninclude the sudden loss of a loved one, the \\nunexpected ending of a romantic \\nrelationship, or the unfair demands of an \\nunreasonable boss.  \\n \\n \\nDefining Stress \\n \\nStress, then, is more than simply the \\ntension and apprehension generated by \\nproblems, obstacles, or traumatic events. \\nStress is the body’s automatic response \\n(physical, mental, and emotional\\n) to any \\nstressor. It is a natural and unavoidable part \\nof life, and it can be empowering and \\nmotivating, or harmful and potentially \\ndangerous.  \\n \\nFor more information on stress click on the \\nlinks below: \\n \\nWhat is Stress?\\n \\n \\nUnderstanding and Dealing with Stress\\n \\n \\nBelow is a video on stress. \\n \\nWhat is stress and what causes it?\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEffects of Stress on Wellness \\n \\nAs stated previously, not all stress is bad. In \\nfact, the stress associated with riding a \\nroller coaster, watching a scary movie, or \\nscaling a cliff can enhance these \\nexperiences. Regardless of whether the \\nstress experienced is negative or positive, \\nthe effects on the body are identical.  \\nWhen a person senses that a situation \\ndemands action, the body responds by \\nreleasing chemicals into the blood. The \\nhypothalamus signals the adrenal glands to \\nrelease a surge of hormones that include \\nadrenaline and cortisol. The physiological \\neffects of those chemicals—enhanced \\nfocus, quicker reaction time, and increased \\nheart rate, energy, and strength—are quite \\nbeneficial when faced with a potentially \\ndangerous situation that is temporary.  \\n \\nUnfortunately, most of the stressors people \\nface—work, school, finances, \\nrelationships—are a part of everyday life, \\nand thus, inescapable. Experiencing \\nongoing, unavoidable stress can result in \\nsome very unpleasant and harmful effects, \\nboth mental and physical. Chronic stress \\ncan cause upset stomach, headaches, sleep \\nproblems, and heart disease. It can also \\ncause depression, anxiety, and even \\nmemory loss.  \\n \\nTo watch a video that describes the effects \\nof stress in detail, click on the link below: \\n \\nHow Stress Affects Your Body and Mind'),\n",

For your convenience, it is also \\nreprinted below with the ADAA’s \\npermission.  \\n \\nWhen you are feeling anxious or stressed, \\nthese strategies will help you cope: \\n \\n• Take a time-out. Practice yoga, \\nlisten to music, meditate, get a \\nmassage, or learn relaxation \\ntechniques. Stepping back from the \\nproblem helps clear your head. \\n• Eat well-balanced meals. Do not \\nskip any meals. Do keep healthful, \\nenergy-boosting snacks on hand. \\n• Limit alcohol and caffeine, which \\ncan aggravate anxiety and trigger \\npanic attacks. \\n• Get enough sleep. When stressed, \\nyour body needs additional sleep \\nand rest. \\n• Exercise daily to help you feel good \\nand maintain your health. Check out \\nthe fitness tips below. \\n• Take deep breaths. Inhale and \\nexhale slowly. \\n• Count to 10 slowly. Repeat, and \\ncount to 20 if necessary. \\n• Do your best. Instead of aiming for \\nperfection, which isn't possible, be \\nproud of however close you get. \\n• Accept that you cannot control \\neverything. Put your stress in \\nperspective: Is it really as bad as you \\nthink? \\n• Welcome humor. A good laugh goes \\na long way. \\n• Maintain a positive attitude. Make \\nan effort to replace negative \\nthoughts with positive ones. \\n• Get involved. Volunteer or find \\nanother way to be active in your \\ncommunity, which creates a support \\nnetwork and gives you a break from \\neveryday stress. \\n• Learn what triggers your anxiety. Is \\nit work, family, school, or something \\nelse you can identify? Write in a \\njournal when you’re feeling stressed \\nor anxious and look for a pattern. \\n• Talk to someone. Tell friends and \\nfamily you’re feeling overwhelmed, \\nand let them know how they can \\nhelp you. Talk to a physician or \\ntherapist for professional help. \\n• Get help online. Lantern offers \\nonline programs guided by \\nprofessional coaches to help you \\nturn healthy anxiety management \\ninto a habit.

Moser \\nObjectives: \\n• Define cancer and how cancer arises \\n• Describe different types of cancer   \\n• Identify cancer risks and methods for cancer prevention \\n• Assess personal cancer risk \\n \\n \\nWhat Is Cancer? \\n \\nCancer is the name given to a collection of \\nrelated diseases in which the body’s cells \\nbegin to divide without stopping and spread \\ninto surrounding tissues. \\n \\nCancer can start almost anywhere in the \\nhuman body, which is made up of trillions \\nof cells. Normally, human cells grow and \\ndivide to form new cells as the body needs \\nthem. When cells grow old or become \\ndamaged, they die, and new cells take their \\nplace. \\n \\nWhen cancer develops, however, this \\norderly process breaks down. As cells \\nbecome more and more abnormal, old or \\ndamaged cells survive when they should \\ndie, and new cells form when they are not \\nneeded. These extra cells can divide \\nwithout stopping and may form growths \\ncalled tumors. \\n \\nMany cancers form solid tumors, which are \\nmasses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such \\nas leukemias, generally do not form solid \\ntumors. \\n \\nCancerous tumors are malignant, which \\nmeans they can spread into, or invade, \\nnearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors \\ngrow, some cancer cells can break off and \\ntravel to distant places in the body through \\nthe blood or the lymph system and form \\nnew tumors far from the original tumor. \\n \\nUnlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do \\nnot invade nearby tissues. However, some \\nbenign tumors can be quite large. When \\nremoved, they usually do not grow back, \\nwhereas malignant tumors sometimes do. \\nUnlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the \\nbody, benign tumors in the brain can be life \\nthreatening. \\n \\n \\nHow Cancer Arises \\n \\nCancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is \\ncaused by changes to genes that control the \\nway our cells function, especially how they \\ngrow and divide. \\n \\nGenetic changes that cause cancer can be \\ninherited. They can also be the result of \\nerrors that occur as cells divide or \\nenvironmental exposures that cause \\ndamage to DNA, the molecules inside cells \\nthat carry genetic information and pass it \\non from one generation to the next. Cancer-\\ncausing environmental exposures include'),\n",

As the \\ncancer continues to grow, additional \\nchanges will occur. Even within the same \\ntumor, different cells may have different \\ngenetic changes. \\n \\nIn general, cancer cells have more genetic \\nchanges, such as mutations in DNA, than \\nnormal cells. Some of these changes may be \\nthe result of the cancer, rather than its \\ncause. \\n \\n \\nCancer Statistics \\n \\nCancer severely impacts Americans and \\nsocieties throughout the world. Cancer \\nstatistics describe what happens in large \\ngroups of people and provide a picture in \\ntime of the burden of cancer on society. \\nStatistics indicate how many people are \\ndiagnosed with and die from cancer each \\nyear, the number of people who are \\ncurrently living after a cancer diagnosis, and \\nthe average age at diagnosis. They also \\nreveal differences among groups defined by \\nage, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic \\nlocation, and other categories. \\n \\nAlthough statistical trends are usually not \\ndirectly applicable to individual patients, \\nthey are essential for governments, \\npolicymakers, health professionals, and \\nresearchers to understand the impact of \\ncancer on the population and to develop \\nstrategies to address the challenges that \\ncancer poses to society.

Cancers may also be described by \\nthe type of cell that formed them, such as \\nan epithelial cell or a squamous cell.   \\n \\nSome types of cancer are: \\n \\nBreast Cancer \\n \\nThe breast is made up of glands called \\nlobules that can make milk and thin tubes \\ncalled ducts that carry the milk from the \\nlobules to the nipple. Breast tissue also \\ncontains fat and connective tissue, lymph \\nnodes, and blood vessels. \\n \\nThe most common type of breast cancer is \\nductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells \\nof the ducts. Breast cancer can also begin in \\nthe cells of the lobules and in other tissues \\nin the breast. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a \\ncondition in which abnormal cells are found \\nin the lining of the ducts but have not \\nspread outside the duct. Breast cancer that \\nhas spread from where it began in the ducts \\nor lobules to surrounding tissue is called \\ninvasive breast cancer. In inflammatory \\nbreast cancer, the breast looks red and \\nswollen and feels warm because the cancer \\ncells block the lymph vessels in the skin. \\n \\nIn the United States, breast cancer is the \\nsecond most common cancer in women \\nafter skin cancer. It can occur in both men \\nand women, but it is rare in men. Each year \\nthere are about 100 times more new cases \\nof breast cancer in women than in men. \\n \\nSome screening tests for breast cancer \\ninclude: \\n \\n• Clinical breast exams and regular \\nbreast self-exams  \\nRoutine examinations of the breasts \\nby health care providers or by \\nwomen themselves have not been \\nshown to reduce deaths from breast \\ncancer. However, if a woman or her \\nhealth care provider notices a lump \\nor other unusual change in the \\nbreast, it is important for her to get \\nit checked out.'),\n",

The \\ncervix leads from the uterus to the vagina, \\nalso known as the birth canal. \\n \\nThe main types of cervical cancer are \\nsquamous cell carcinoma and \\nadenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma \\nbegins in the thin, flat cells that line the \\ncervix. Adenocarcinoma begins in cervical \\ncells that make mucus and other fluids. \\n \\nLong-lasting infections with certain types of \\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV) cause almost \\nall cases of cervical cancer. Vaccines that \\nprotect against infection with these types of \\nHPV can greatly reduce the risk of cervical \\ncancer.  \\n \\n \\nScreening tests: \\n• Pap test and human papillomavirus \\n(HPV) testing \\nHaving a Pap test to check for \\nabnormal cells in the cervix, or a test \\nto check for HPV, can find cells that \\nmay become cervical cancer. These \\ncells can be treated before cancer \\nforms.  Testing is generally \\nrecommended to begin at age 21 \\nand to end at age 65, as long as \\nrecent results have been normal. \\n \\nCervical cancer can usually be cured \\nif it is found and treated in the early \\nstages. \\n \\n \\nColorectal Cancer \\n \\nColorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the \\ncolon or rectum. The colon and the rectum \\nare parts of the large intestine, which is the \\nlower part of the body’s digestive system. \\nDuring digestion, food moves through the \\nstomach and small intestine into the colon. \\nThe colon absorbs water and nutrients from \\nthe food and stores waste matter called \\nstool. Stool moves from the colon into the \\nrectum before it leaves the body. \\n \\nMost colorectal cancers are \\nadenocarcinomas, cancers that begin in \\ncells that make and release mucus and \\nother fluids.

Unless \\nmelanoma is diagnosed early, it is likely to \\ninvade nearby tissues and spread to other \\nparts of the body. The number of cases of \\nmelanoma increases each year. Only 2 \\npercent of all skin cancers are melanoma, \\nbut it causes the most deaths from skin \\ncancer. \\n \\n \\n \\nScreening test: \\n• Skin exams \\nDoctors often recommend that \\npeople who are at risk for skin \\ncancer examine their skin regularly \\nor have a health care provider do so. \\nSuch exams have not been shown to \\ndecrease the risk of dying from skin \\ncancer, and they may lead to \\novertreatment. However, people \\nshould be aware of changes in their \\nskin, such as a new mole or a change \\nto an existing mole, and report these \\nto their doctor promptly. \\n \\n \\nTesticular Cancer \\n \\nThe testicles are two glands inside the \\nscrotum, a sac of loose skin below the \\npenis. The testicles make sperm and the \\nhormone testosterone. \\n \\nTesticular cancer is the most common \\ncancer in men aged from 15 to 34 years. \\nThe two main types of testicular tumors are \\nseminoma and nonseminoma. \\nNonseminomas tend to grow and spread \\nmore quickly than seminomas. \\n \\nThe most common sign of testicular cancer \\nis a lump or swelling in the testicle.

It is considered a \\nbrain disease because drugs change the \\nbrain by changing its structure and how it \\nworks. These brain changes can be long-\\nlasting and can lead to the harmful \\nbehaviors seen in people who abuse drugs. \\n \\nAddiction is a lot like other diseases, such as \\nheart disease. Both disrupt the normal, \\nhealthy functioning of the underlying organ, \\nhave serious harmful consequences, and \\nare preventable and treatable, but if left \\nuntreated, can last a lifetime. \\n \\n \\nWhy do people use drugs? \\n \\nIn general, people begin taking drugs for a \\nvariety of reasons: \\n \\n• To feel good  \\nMost abused drugs produce intense \\nfeelings of pleasure. This initial \\nsensation of euphoria is followed by \\nother effects, which differ \\ndepending on the type of drug used. \\nFor example, with stimulants such as \\ncocaine, the “high” is followed by \\nfeelings of power, self-confidence, \\nand increased energy. In contrast, \\nthe euphoria caused by opiates, \\nsuch as heroin, is followed by \\nfeelings of relaxation and \\nsatisfaction. \\n \\n• To feel better \\nSome people who suffer from social \\nanxiety, stress-related disorders, \\nand depression begin abusing drugs \\nin an attempt to lessen feelings of \\ndistress. Stress can play a major role \\nin initial drug use, continuing drug \\nabuse, or relapse in patients \\nrecovering from addiction. \\n \\n• To do better  \\nSome people feel pressure to \\nchemically enhance or improve their \\ncognitive or athletic performance, \\nwhich can play a role in initial \\nexperimentation and continued'),\n",

However, drugs can quickly take \\nover a person’s life. Over time, if drug use \\ncontinues, other pleasurable activities \\nbecome less pleasurable and taking the \\ndrug becomes necessary for the user just to \\nfeel normal.

Beyond \\nbeing the first sign of a syphilis infection, \\nchancres make a person two to five times \\nmore likely to contract an HIV infection. If \\nthe person is already infected with HIV, \\nchancres also increase the likelihood that \\nthe virus will be passed on to a sexual \\npartner.\\n3 These sores typically resolve on \\ntheir own, even without treatment. \\nHowever, the body does not clear the \\ninfection on its own, and, over time, syphilis \\nmay involve other organs, including the \\nskin, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and \\njoints in secondary syphilis.

The most common sign of a \\nbacterial vaginosis infection is a thin, milky \\ndischarge that is often described as having a \\n\"fishy\" odor. However, some women will \\nhave no symptoms at all. \\nRegardless of symptoms, having bacterial \\nvaginosis increases the risk of getting other \\nSTDs/STIs and is also associated with pelvic \\ninflammatory disease (PID), an infection of \\nthe female reproductive organs, including \\nthe uterus and the fallopian tubes (which \\ncarry eggs to the uterus), and postoperative \\ninfections.

The parasite \\nalso infects men, though less frequently. \\nThe parasite can be transmitted between \\nmen and women as well as between \\nwomen whenever physical contact occurs \\nbetween the genital areas. Although \\nTrichomonas infections do not always cause \\nsymptoms, they can cause frequent, \\npainful, or burning urination in men and \\nwomen as well as vaginal discharge, genital \\nsoreness, redness, or itching in women. \\nBecause the infection can occur without \\nsymptoms, a person may be unaware that \\nhe or she is infected and continue to re-\\ninfect a sexual partner who is having \\nrecurrent signs of infection. As with \\nbacterial STDs/STIs, all sexual partners \\nshould be treated at the same time to avoid \\nre-infection. \\n \\nNICHD-sponsored research has shown that \\nduring pregnancy, Trichomonas infection is \\nassociated with an increased risk of \\npremature birth and infants with low birth \\nweight.

Obviously, your \\nindividual goals differ from those of your \\nfellow classmates, but everyone’s goals \\nshare one common attribute: their \\nintention to improve individual wellbeing. \\nHowever, there are as many ideas about \\nhow to do that as there are individuals. Do \\nyour goals involve making more money, \\nachieving better health, improving your \\nrelationships? Holistic wellness involves all \\nthose aspects of life and more. This chapter \\nexplains the importance of overall wellness, \\nwhich is about more than being physically \\nand mentally healthy, free from illness and \\ndisease. In fact, the study of wellness \\nincorporates all aspects of life. Achieving \\noverall wellness means living actively and \\nfully. People in this state exude confidence, \\noptimism, and self-efficacy; they have the \\nenergy reserves to do what needs to be \\ndone today and to plan for a better \\ntomorrow. The most effective and \\ntransformative goals are those designed to \\nachieve the highest level of personal \\nwellness.  \\n \\n \\nDimensions of Wellness \\n \\nWellness is a familiar term, but what is its \\ntrue definition? Is it simply the absence of \\ndisease? This chapter will define all the \\ncomponents of holistic wellness and \\ndescribe the factors that contribute to not \\nonly a person’s physical and mental health, \\nbut also their ability to develop, thrive, \\nsucceed, enjoy life, and meet challenges \\nhead on with confidence and resolve.  \\n \\nTo achieve this type of overall wellness, a \\nperson must be healthy in nine \\ninterconnected dimensions of wellness: \\nphysical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, \\nsocial, environmental, occupational, \\nfinancial, and cultural. A description of each \\ndimension follows. \\n \\n \\nThe Nine Dimensions of Wellness \\n \\n• Physical Wellness \\nPeople who are physically well \\nactively make healthy decisions on a \\ndaily basis.

They maintain positive \\ninterpersonal relationships and \\nmake healthy sexual decisions that \\nare consistent with their personal \\nvalues and beliefs. \\n \\n• Emotional Wellness \\nAn emotionally well person \\nsuccessfully expresses and manages \\nan entire range of feelings, including \\nanger, doubt, hope, joy, desire, fear, \\nand many others.  People who are \\nemotionally well maintain a high \\nlevel of self-esteem. They have a \\npositive body-image and the ability \\nto regulate their feelings. They know \\nwhere to seek support and help \\nregarding their mental health, \\nincluding but not limited to, seeking \\nprofessional counseling services. \\n \\n• Intellectual Wellness \\nThose who enjoy intellectual \\nwellness engage in lifelong learning. \\nThey seek knowledge and activities \\nthat further develop their critical \\nthinking and heighten global \\nawareness. They engage in activities \\nassociated with the arts, philosophy, \\nand reasoning. \\n \\n• Spiritual Wellness \\nPeople who can be described as \\nspiritually well have identified a core \\nset of beliefs that guide their \\ndecision making, and other faith- \\nbased endeavors. While firm in their \\nspiritual beliefs, they understand \\nothers may have a distinctly \\ndifferent set of guiding principles. \\nThey recognize the relationship \\nbetween spirituality and identity in \\nall individuals. \\n \\n• Social Wellness \\nA socially well person builds healthy \\nrelationships based on \\ninterdependence, trust, and \\nrespect.  Those who are socially well \\nhave a keen awareness of the \\nfeelings of others. They develop a \\nnetwork of friends and co-workers \\nwho share a common purpose, and \\nwho provide support and validation. \\n \\n• Environmental Wellness \\nAn environmentally well person \\nappreciates the external cues and \\nstimuli that an environment can \\nprovide.  People who have achieved \\nenvironmental wellness recognize \\nthe limits to controlling an \\nenvironment and seek to \\nunderstand the role an individual \\nplays in the environment. \\n \\n• Occupational Wellness \\nAn occupationally well person \\nenjoys the pursuit of a career which \\nis fulfilling on a variety of levels. This \\nperson finds satisfaction and \\nenrichment in work, while always in \\npursuit of opportunities to reach the \\nnext level of professional success. \\n \\n• Financial Wellness \\nThose who are financially well are \\nfully aware of their current financial \\nstate.

This section will explore how changes \\nto behavior occur, the psychological \\nbarriers that hamper efforts to change, and \\ntips for making lasting change. \\n \\n \\nHow Changes in Behavior Occur \\n \\nThe Transtheoretical Model, also called the \\nStages of Change Model, was developed by \\nJames Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente in \\nthe late 1970s. Considered the dominant \\nmodel for describing how behavior changes \\noccur, it evolved through studies examining \\nthe experiences of smokers who quit on \\ntheir own and comparing them with the \\nexperiences of those requiring further \\ntreatment. The goal of those studies was to \\nunderstand why some people were capable \\nof quitting on their own. It was determined \\nthat people quit smoking if they were ready \\nto do so. Thus, the Transtheoretical Model \\n(TTM) focuses on the decision-making of \\nthe individual and is a model of intentional \\nchange. The TTM operates on the \\nassumption that people do not change \\nbehaviors quickly and decisively. Rather, \\nchange in behavior, especially habitual \\nbehavior, occurs continuously through a \\ncyclical process. The TTM is not a theory but \\na model; different behavioral theories and \\nconstructs can be applied to various stages \\nof the model where they may be most \\neffective. \\n \\nThe TTM posits that individuals move \\nthrough six stages of change: \\nprecontemplation, contemplation, \\npreparation, action, maintenance, and \\ntermination. Termination was not part of \\nthe original model and is less often used in \\napplication of stages of change for health-\\nrelated behaviors. For each stage of change, \\ndifferent intervention strategies are most \\neffective at moving the person to the next \\nstage of change and subsequently through \\nthe model to maintenance, the ideal stage \\nof behavior. \\n \\nSix Stages of Change: \\n \\n• Stage 1: Precontemplation \\nIn this stage, people do not intend \\nto take action in the foreseeable \\nfuture (defined as within the next 6 \\nmonths). People are often unaware \\nthat their behavior is problematic or \\nproduces negative consequences. \\nPeople in this stage often \\nunderestimate the pros of changing \\nbehavior and place too much \\nemphasis on the cons of changing \\nbehavior.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Healthy Behaviors and Wellness  5 \\n \\n• Stage 2: Contemplation \\nIn this stage, people are intending to \\nstart the healthy behavior in the \\nforeseeable future (defined as \\nwithin the next 6 months). People \\nrecognize that their behavior may be \\nproblematic, and a more thoughtful \\nand practical consideration of the \\npros and cons of changing the \\nbehavior takes place, with equal \\nemphasis placed on both. Even with \\nthis recognition, people may still feel \\nambivalent toward changing their \\nbehavior. \\n \\n• Stage 3: Preparation \\n(Determination) \\nIn this stage, people are ready to \\ntake action within the next 30 days. \\nPeople start to take small steps \\ntoward the behavior change, and \\nthey believe changing their behavior \\ncan lead to a healthier life. \\n \\n \\n \\n• Stage 4: Action \\nIn this stage, people have recently \\nchanged their behavior (defined as \\nwithin the last 6 months) and intend \\nto keep moving forward with that  \\nbehavior change. People may exhibit \\nthis by modifying their problem \\nbehavior or acquiring new healthy \\nbehaviors. \\n \\n• Stage 5: Maintenance \\nIn this stage, people have sustained \\ntheir behavior change for a while \\n(defined as more than 6 months) \\nand intend to maintain the behavior \\nchange going forward. People in this \\nstage work to prevent relapse to \\nearlier stages. \\n \\n• Stage 6: Termination \\nIn this stage, people have no desire \\nto return to their unhealthy \\nbehaviors and are sure they will not \\nrelapse. Since this is rarely reached, \\nand people tend to stay in the \\nmaintenance stage, this stage is'),\n",

Ten processes of \\nchange have been identified, with some \\nprocesses being more relevant to a specific \\nstage of change than other processes. \\nThese processes result in strategies that \\nhelp people make and maintain change. \\n \\nTen Processes of Change: \\n \\n1. Consciousness Raising \\nIncreasing awareness about the \\nhealthy behavior. \\n \\n2. Dramatic Relief \\nEmotional arousal about the health \\nbehavior, whether positive or \\nnegative arousal. \\n \\n3. Self-Reevaluation \\nSelf-reappraisal to realize the \\nhealthy behavior is part of who they \\nwant to be. \\n \\n4.

The questionnaires that \\nhave been developed to assign a \\nperson to a stage of change are not \\nalways standardized or validated. \\n \\n• No clear sense exists for how much \\ntime is needed for each stage, or \\nhow long a person can remain in a \\nstage.\"),\n",

In other words, \\nthe interventions involve a message or \\nprogram component that has been \\nspecifically created for a target population's \\nlevel of knowledge and motivation.

Olson, a psychology professor \\nat the University of Western Ontario, \\nLondon, has identified several psychological \\nbarriers that commonly prevent people \\nfrom taking action, even when inaction \\nposes a threat to their health. These \\nbarriers occur during 3 stages of behavior \\nmodification: admission of the problem, \\ninitial attempts to change, and long-term \\nchange as outlined below: \\n \\n• Barriers to Admission of the problem \\nThe first step in lasting change is \\nadmitting a problem exists. People \\noften fail to change behavior that \\nposes a risk to their health because \\nthey deny a risk exists,  trivialize \\ntheir personal risk, feel invulnerable, \\nmake a faulty conceptualization, \\n(i.e., they attribute early warning \\nsigns to a benign cause), or \\nexperience debilitating emotions \\nwhen contemplating preventative \\nmeasures.  \\n \\n• Barriers to Initial Attempts to \\nChange \\nAt this stage, people acknowledge \\nthe need to change but struggle to \\naccomplish their goals. This failure is \\na result of lack of knowledge, low \\nself-efficacy (the belief in one’s own \\nability to succeed at change), and \\ndysfunctional attitudes.  \\n \\n• Barriers to long-term change \\nJust because a person has \\nexperienced success in changing a \\nbehavior, that doesn’t mean the \\nchange is permanent.

You have tried before—\\nprobably declaring another attempt as a \\nNew Year’s resolution—but without \\nexperiencing much success. Making a \\nlifestyle change is challenging, especially \\nwhen you want to transform many things at \\nonce. This time, think of those changes not \\nas a resolution but as an evolution. \\n \\nLifestyle changes are a process that take \\ntime and require support. Once you are \\nready to make a change, the difficult part is \\ncommitting and following through. So do \\nyour research and make a plan that will \\nprepare you for success. Careful planning \\nmeans setting small goals and taking things \\none step at a time. \\nHere are five tips from the American \\nPsychological Association (APA) that will \\nassist you in making lasting, positive \\nlifestyle and behavior changes: \\n \\n• Make a plan that will stick. \\nYour plan is a map that will guide \\nyou on this journey of change. You \\ncan even think of it as an adventure. \\nWhen making your plan, be specific. \\nWant to exercise more? Detail the \\ntime of day when you can take walks \\nand how long you will walk. Write \\neverything down, and ask yourself if \\nyou are confident that these \\nactivities and goals are realistic for \\nyou. If not, start with smaller steps. \\nPost your plan where you will most \\noften see it as a reminder. \\n \\n• Start small. \\nAfter you've identified realistic \\nshort-term and long-term goals, \\nbreak down your goals into small, \\nmanageable steps that are \\nspecifically defined and can be \\nmeasured. Is your long-term goal to \\nlose 20 pounds within the next five \\nmonths? A good weekly goal would \\nbe to lose one pound a week. If you \\nwould like to eat healthier, consider \\nas a goal for the week replacing \\ndessert with a healthier option, like \\nfruit or yogurt. At the end of the \\nweek, you will feel successful \\nknowing you met your goal. \\n \\n• Change one behavior at a time. \\nUnhealthy behaviors develop over \\nthe course of time, so replacing \\nunhealthy behaviors with healthy \\nones requires time. Many people \\nrun into problems when they try to \\nchange too much too fast. To\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Healthy Behaviors and Wellness  9 \\n \\nimprove your success, focus on one \\ngoal or change at a time. As new \\nhealthy behaviors become a habit, \\ntry to add another goal that works \\ntoward the overall change you are \\nstriving for. \\n \\n• Involve a buddy.  \\nWhether it be a friend, co-worker or \\nfamily member, someone else on \\nyour journey will keep you \\nmotivated and accountable. Perhaps \\nit can be someone who will go to the \\ngym with you or someone who is \\nalso trying to stop smoking. Talk \\nabout what you are doing. Consider \\njoining a support group. Having \\nsomeone with whom to share your \\nstruggles and successes makes the \\nwork easier and the mission less \\nintimidating. \\n \\n• Ask for support.  \\nAccepting help from those who care \\nabout you and will listen \\nstrengthens your resilience and \\ncommitment. If you feel \\noverwhelmed or unable to meet \\nyour goals on your own, consider \\nseeking help from a psychologist. \\nPsychologists are uniquely trained to \\nunderstand the connection between \\nthe mind and body, as well as the \\nfactors that promote behavior \\nchange. Asking for help does not \\nmean a lifetime of therapy; even just \\na few sessions can help you examine \\nand set attainable goals or address \\nthe emotional issues that may be \\ngetting in your way. \\n \\n \\n \\nStart with “Why?” \\n \\nMaking changes in habitual behavior \\nrequires a deep and abiding belief that \\nchange is needed. Your desire to change \\nmay be motivated by personal goals, or it \\nmay be the result of the impact your \\nimproved wellness will have on those you \\nlove. Nietzsche said, “He who has a strong \\nenough why can bear almost any how.”  \\n \\nOnce you have a compelling reason to \\nchange, develop a plan and commit to that \\nplan. If you experience a moment of \\nweakness, do not waste time on self-\\ncondemnation. Revisit your compelling \\nreason and reaffirm your commitment to \\nchange. The health, peace, and sense of \\nwellbeing inherent in the highest level of \\nyour own personal wellness is more than \\nworth the effort required to change. \\n \\nFor more information about making \\npermanent lifestyle changes, go to the APA \\nwebsite linked below: \\n \\nLIfestyle Changes That Last\\n \\n \\n \\nAssessing Your Personal \\nLifestyle Behaviors \\n \\nComplete the following lab.

Our Paleolithic \\nancestors regularly engaged in physical activity \\nto survive. However, rather than chasing after a \\nsoccer ball to win a game or taking a leisurely \\nstroll down a tree-lined path, they “worked out” \\nby chasing after their next meal. For them, no \\nexercise meant no food. How’s that for a health \\nbenefit? \\nWith the advent of sedentary agriculture some \\n10,000 years ago, that same level of peak \\nperformance was no longer necessary. As our \\nancestors continued to devise more advanced \\nmeans of acquiring food, physical activity \\ndeclined. It wasn’t until the fourth century BCE, \\nthat the Greek physician Herodicus, recognized \\nthe importance of being physically active \\noutside of a hunter-gatherer society. He \\npracticed gymnastic medicine, a branch of \\nGreek medicine that relied on vigorous exercise \\nas a treatment. During that same time period, \\nHippocrates, who is often referred to as the \\nFather of Modern Medicine, asserted, “If we \\ncould give every individual the right amount of \\nnourishment and exercise, not too little and not \\ntoo much, we would have found the safest way \\nto health.”  In the 12 century CE, the Jewish \\nphilosopher Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, a \\nphysician to the Sultan of Egypt, stated, \\n”Anyone who lives a sedentary life and does not \\nexercise, even if he eats good foods and takes \\ncare of himself according to proper medical \\nprinciples, all his days will be painful ones and \\nhis strength will wane.”\\n  The 15th century \\ntheologian and scholar Robert Burton went so \\nfar as to declare that not exercising, or \\n“idleness” as he referred to it in his widely read \\ntome, The Anatomy of Melancholy, was the \\n“bane of body and mind.” Burton also warned \\nthat the lack of exercise was the sole cause of \\nmelancholy (the name given depression at that \\ntime) and “many other maladies.” Burton \\nclaimed that idleness was one of the seven \\ndeadly, as well as “the nurse of naughtiness,” \\nand the “chief author of mischief.” For Burton, \\nexercise was not only essential for good health, \\nbut a means of avoiding eternal damnation.  \\n  \\nBy the 16th century, the benefits of exercise \\nwere widely accepted, at least among the \\nwealthy and the educated, who had access to \\nleisure. During this time period, H. Mercuralis \\ndefined exercise as “the deliberate and planned \\nmovement of the human frame, accompanied \\nby breathlessness, and undertaken for the sake \\nof health or fitness.” This definition is still \\nwidely used today.  \\n \\nBeyond the physical health benefits, there are \\naffective benefits associated with group games'),\n",

In \\nsome cases the captain of the losing team gave \\nhimself as a human sacrifice to the winning \\nteam, an act that was believed by the Mayans \\nto be a vital part of prosperity.  \\nAmerican Indians are thought to have founded \\nthe modern game of lacrosse, as well as other \\nstick games.

George Catlin. Date unknown. \\nThe outcome of the game, as well as the \\nchoosing of teams, was thought to be \\ncontrolled supernaturally. As such, game \\nvenues and equipment were prepared \\nritualistically.  \\nFrom Ancient History to Modern \\nTimes \\nIn retrospect, the perceived benefits of exercise \\nhave changed very little since Herodicus or the \\nAmerican Indians. Mounting research supports \\nhistorical assertions that exercise is vital to \\nsustaining health and quality of life.  Culturally, \\nsports play a huge role in growth and \\ndevelopment of youth and adults. Physically, \\nthere is indisputable evidence that regular \\nexercise promotes healthy functioning of the \\nbrain, heart, and the skeletal and muscular \\nsystems. Exercise also reduces risk for chronic \\ndiseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity. \\nRegular exercise can even improve emotional \\nhealth and overall wellbeing.  \\nWhat are Physical Activity \\nand Exercise? \\n \\nPhysical activity is defined as any movement \\ncarried out by skeletal muscle that requires \\nenergy and is focused on building health. Health \\nbenefits include improved blood pressure, \\nblood-lipid profile, and heart health. Acceptable \\nphysical activity includes yard work, house \\ncleaning, walking the dog, or taking the stairs \\ninstead of the elevator. Physical activity does \\nnot have to be done all it once. It can be \\naccumulated through various activities \\nthroughout the day. Although typing on a \\nphone or laptop or playing video games does \\ninvolve skeletal muscle and requires a minimal \\namount of energy, the amount required is not \\nsufficient to improve health.  \\n \\nDespite the common knowledge that physical \\nactivity is tremendously beneficial to one’s \\nhealth, rates of activity among Americans \\ncontinue to be below what is needed. According \\nto the Center for Disease Control (CDC), only 1 \\nin 5 (21%) of American adults meet the \\nrecommended physical activity guidelines from \\nthe Surgeon General. Less than 3 in 10 high \\nschool students get 60 minutes or more of \\nphysical activity per day. Non-Hispanic whites \\n(26%) are more active than their Hispanic (16%) \\nand Black counterparts (18%) as is the case for \\nmales (54%) and females (46%). Those with \\nmore education and those whose household \\nincome is higher than poverty level are more \\nlikely to be physically active.\\n1 \\nThe word exercise, although often used \\ninterchangeably with the phrase physical \\nactivity, denotes a sub-category of physical'),\n",

Exercise is a planned, structured, and \\nrepetitive movement pattern intended to \\nimprove fitness. As a positive side-effect, it \\nsignificantly improves health as well. Fitness \\nimprovements include the heart’s ability to \\npump blood, increased muscle size, and \\nimproved flexibility.  \\nComponents of Health-Related \\nFitness \\n \\nIn order to carry out daily activities without \\nbeing physically overwhelmed, a minimal level \\nof fitness is required. To perform daily activities \\nwithout fatigue, it is necessary to maintain \\nhealth in five areas: cardiorespiratory \\nendurance, muscular strength and endurance, \\nflexibility, and body composition. These five \\nareas are called the components of health-\\nrelated fitness. Development of these areas will \\nimprove your quality of life, reduce your risk of \\nchronic disease, and optimize your health and \\nwell-being. Each of these 5 areas will be \\nexplored in depth at a later time. Below is a \\nbrief description of each. \\n \\n• Cardiorespiratory endurance \\nCardiorespiratory endurance is the \\nability to carry out prolonged, large \\nmuscle, dynamic movements at a \\nmoderate to high level of intensity. This \\nrelates to your heart’s ability to pump \\nblood and your lungs’ ability to take in \\noxygen.  \\n• Muscular strength \\nMuscular strength is the ability of the \\nmuscles to exert force over a single or \\nmaximal effort.  \\n \\n• Muscular endurance \\nMuscular endurance is the ability to \\nexert a force over a period of time or \\nrepetitions.  \\n \\n• Flexibility \\nFlexibility is the ability to move your \\njoints through a full range of motion.  \\n \\n• Body Composition \\nBody composition is the relative \\namount of fat mass to fat-free mass.  \\n \\nAs previously stated, these areas are significant \\nin that they influence your quality of life and \\noverall health and wellness.  \\n \\nSkill-Related Components of Fitness \\n \\nIn addition to the 5 health-related components, \\nthere are 6 skill-related components that assist \\nin developing optimal fitness: speed, agility, \\ncoordination, balance, power, and reaction \\ntime. Although important, these areas do not \\ndirectly affect a person’s health. A person’s \\nability to perform ladder drills (also known as \\nagility drills) is not related to his/her heart \\nhealth. However, coordination of muscle \\nmovements may be helpful in developing \\nmuscular strength through resistance training.  \\nAs such, they may indirectly affect the 5 areas \\nassociated with health-related fitness. Skill-\\nrelated components are more often associated \\nwith sports performance and skill development.  \\n \\n \\nPrinciples of Adaptation to \\nStress \\n \\nThe human body adapts well when exposed \\nto stress. The term stress, within the \\ncontext of exercise, is defined as an \\nexertion above the normal, everyday \\nfunctioning. The specific activities that \\nresult in stress vary for each individual and \\ndepend on a person’s level of fitness. For \\nexample, a secretary who sits at a desk all \\nday may push his/her cardiorespiratory \\nsystem to its limits simply by walking up'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='4 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nseveral flights of stairs. For an avid runner, \\nresistance training may expose the runner’s \\nmuscles to muscular contractions the \\nathlete is not accustomed to feeling. \\nAlthough stress is relative to each \\nindividual, there are guiding principles in \\nexercise that can help individuals manage \\nhow much stress they experience to avoid \\ninjury and optimize their body’s capacity to \\nadapt. Knowing a little about these \\nprinciples provides valuable insights needed \\nfor organizing an effective fitness plan.   \\n \\n \\nOverload Principle \\n \\nConsider the old saying, “No pain, no gain.” \\nDoes exercise really have to be painful, as \\nthis adage implies, to be beneficial? \\nAbsolutely not. If that were true, exercise \\nwould be a lot less enjoyable. Perhaps a \\nbetter way to relay the same message \\nwould be to say that improvements are \\ndriven by stress. Physical stress, such as \\nwalking at a brisk pace or jogging, places \\nincreased stress on the regulatory systems \\nthat manage increased heart rate and blood \\npressure, increased energy production, \\nincreased breathing, and even increased \\nsweating for temperature regulation. As \\nthese subsequent adaptations occur, the \\nstress previously experienced during the \\nsame activity, feels less stressful in future \\nsessions. As a result of the adaptation, \\nmore stress must be applied to the system \\nin order to stimulate improvements, a \\nprinciple known as the overload principle.   \\n \\nFor example, a beginning weightlifter \\nperforms squats with 10 repetitions at 150 \\npounds. After 2 weeks of lifting this weight, \\nthe lifter notices the 150 pounds feels \\neasier during the lift and afterwards causes \\nless fatigue. The lifter adds 20 pounds and \\ncontinues with the newly established stress \\nof 170 pounds. The lifter will continue to \\nget stronger until his/her maximum \\ncapacity has been reached, or the stress \\nstays the same, at which point the lifter’s \\nstrength will simply plateau. This same \\nprinciple can be applied, not only to gain \\nmuscular strength, but also to gain \\nflexibility, muscular endurance, and \\ncardiorespiratory endurance.  \\n \\nFITT \\n \\nIn exercise, the amount of stress placed on \\nthe body can be controlled by four \\nvariables: Frequency, Intensity, Time \\n(duration), and Type, better known as FITT. \\nThe FITT principle, as outlined by the \\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine \\n(ACSM) falls under the larger principle of \\noverload.  \\n \\n \\nFrequency and Time \\n \\nEach variable can be used independently or \\nin combination with other variables to \\nimpose new stress and stimulate \\nadaptation. Such is the case for frequency \\nand time. \\n  \\nFrequency relates to how often exercises \\nare performed over a period of time. In \\nmost cases, the number of walking or \\njogging sessions would be determined over \\nthe course of a week. A beginner may \\ndetermine that 2–3 exercise sessions a \\nweek are sufficient enough to stimulate \\nimprovements. On the other hand, a \\nseasoned veteran may find that 2–3 days is \\nnot enough to adequately stress the \\nsystem. According to the overload principle, \\nas fitness improves, so must the stress to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='5 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nensure continued gains and to avoid \\nplateauing.  \\n \\nThe duration of exercise, or time, also \\ncontributes to the amount of stress \\nexperienced during a workout. Certainly, a \\n30-minute brisk walk is less stressful on the \\nbody than a 4-hour marathon.  \\n \\nAlthough independent of one another, \\nfrequency and time are often combined \\ninto the blanket term, volume. The idea is \\nthat volume more accurately reflects the \\namount of stress experienced. This can be \\nconnected to the progression principle. For \\nexample, when attempting to create a \\njogging plan, you may organize 2 weeks like \\nthis:  \\n \\n• Week 1: three days a week at 30 \\nminutes per session \\n• Week 2: four days a week at 45 \\nminutes per session \\n \\nAt first glance, this might appear to be a \\ngood progression of frequency and time. \\nHowever, when calculated in terms of \\nvolume, the aggressive nature of the \\nprogression is revealed. In week 1, three \\ndays at 30 minutes per session equals 90 \\nminutes of total exercise. In week two, this \\namount was doubled with four days at 45 \\nminutes, equaling 180 minutes of total \\nexercise. Doing too much, too soon, will \\nalmost certainly lead to burnout, severe \\nfatigue, and injury. The progression \\nprinciple relates to an optimal overload of \\nthe body by finding an amount that will \\ndrive adaptation without compromising \\nsafety.  \\n \\n \\nType of Exercise \\n \\nSimply put, the type of exercise performed \\nshould reflect a person’s goals. In \\ncardiorespiratory fitness, the objective of \\nthe exercise is to stimulate the \\ncardiorespiratory system. Other activities \\nthat accomplish the same objective include \\nswimming, biking, dancing, cross country \\nskiing, aerobic classes, and much more. As \\nsuch, these activities can be used to build \\nlung capacity and improve cellular and \\nheart function. \\n \\nHowever, the more specific the exercise, \\nthe better. While vigorous ballroom dancing \\nwill certainly help develop the \\ncardiorespiratory system, it will unlikely \\nimprove a person’s 10k time. To improve \\nperformance in a 10k, athletes spend the \\nmajority of their time training by running, \\nas they will have to do in the actual 10k. \\nCyclists training for the Tour de France, \\nspend up to six hours a day in the saddle, \\npeddling feverishly. These athletes know \\nthe importance of training the way they \\nwant their body to adapt. This concept, \\ncalled the principle of specificity, should be \\ntaken into consideration when creating a \\ntraining plan.   \\n \\nIn this discussion of type and the principle \\nof specificity, a few additional items should \\nbe considered. Stress, as it relates to \\nexercise, is very specific. There are multiple \\ntypes of stress. The three main stressors are \\nmetabolic stress, force stress, and \\nenvironmental stress. Keep in mind, the \\nbody will adapt based on the type of stress \\nbeing placed on it.  \\n \\nMetabolic stress results from exercise \\nsessions when the energy systems of the \\nbody are taxed. For example, sprinting short \\ndistances requires near maximum intensity'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='6 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nand requires energy (ATP) to be produced \\nprimarily through anaerobic pathways, that \\nis, pathways not requiring oxygen to \\nproduce ATP. Anaerobic energy production \\ncan only be supported for a very limited \\ntime (10 seconds to 2 minutes). However, \\ndistance running at steady paces requires \\naerobic energy production, which can last \\nfor hours. As a result, the training strategy \\nfor the distance runner must be different \\nthan the training plan of a sprinter, so the \\nenergy systems will adequately adapt.  \\n \\nLikewise, force stress accounts for the \\namount of force required during an activity. \\nIn weightlifting, significant force production \\nis required to lift heavy loads. The type of \\nmuscles being developed, fast-twitch \\nmuscle fibers, must be recruited to support \\nthe activity. In walking and jogging, the \\nforces being absorbed come from the body \\nweight combined with forward momentum. \\nSlow twitch fibers, which are unable to \\ngenerate as much force as the fast twitch \\nfibers, are the type of muscle fibers \\nprimarily recruited in this activity. Because \\nthe force requirements differ, the training \\nstrategies must also vary to develop the \\nright kind of musculature.  \\n \\nEnvironmental stress, such as exercising in \\nthe heat, places a tremendous amount of \\nstress on the thermoregulatory systems. As \\nan adaptation to the heat, the amount of \\nsweating increases as does plasma volume, \\nmaking it much easier to keep the body at a \\nnormal temperature during exercise. The \\nonly way to adapt is through heat exposure, \\nwhich can take days to weeks to properly \\nadapt.  \\n \\nIn summary, to improve performance, being \\nspecific in your training, or training the way \\nyou want to adapt, is paramount.  \\n \\n \\nIntensity \\n \\nIntensity, the degree of difficulty at which \\nthe exercise is carried out, is the most \\nimportant variable of FITT. More than any \\nof the other components, intensity drives \\nadaptation. Because of its importance, it is \\nimperative for those beginning a fitness \\nprogram to quantify intensity, as opposed \\nto estimating it as hard, easy, or \\nsomewhere in between. Not only will this \\nnumeric value provide a better \\nunderstanding of the effort level during the \\nexercise session, but it will also help in \\ndesigning sessions that accommodate \\nindividual goals.  \\n \\nHow then can intensity be measured? Heart \\nrate is one of the best ways to measure a \\nperson’s effort level for cardiorespiratory \\nfitness.  Using a percentage of maximum \\nlifting capacity would be the measure used \\nfor resistance training.  \\n \\n \\nRest, Recovery, and Periodization \\n \\nFor hundreds of years, athletes have been \\nchallenged to balance their exercise efforts \\nwith performance improvements and \\nadequate rest. The principle of rest and \\nrecovery (or principle of recuperation) \\nsuggests that rest and recovery from the \\nstress of exercise must take place in \\nproportionate amounts to avoid too much \\nstress. One systematic approach to rest and \\nrecovery has led exercise scientists and \\nathletes alike to divide the progressive \\nfitness training phases into blocks, or \\nperiods. As a result, optimal rest and \\nrecovery can be achieved without'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='7 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\noverstressing the athlete. This training \\nprinciple, called periodization, is especially \\nimportant to serious athletes but can be \\napplied to most exercise plans as well. The \\nprinciple of periodization suggests that \\ntraining plans incorporate phases of stress \\nfollowed by phases of rest.  \\n \\nTraining phases can be organized on a daily, \\nweekly, monthly, and even multi-annual \\ncycles, called micro-, meso-, and \\nmacrocycles, respectively. An example of \\nthis might be: \\n \\nWeek Frequency Intensity Time Type \\n1 3 days 40% HRR 25 min walk \\n2 4 days 40% HRR 30 min walk \\n3 4 days 50% HRR 35 min walk \\n4 2 days 30% HRR 30 min other \\n \\nAs this table shows, the volume and \\nintensity changes from week 1 to week 3. \\nBut, in week 4, the volume and intensity \\ndrops significantly to accommodate a \\ndesignated rest week. If the chart were \\ncontinued, weeks 5-7 would be “stress” \\nweeks and week 8 would be another rest \\nweek. This pattern could be followed for \\nseveral months.  \\n \\nWithout periodization, the stress from \\nexercise would continue indefinitely \\neventually leading to fatigue, possible \\ninjury, and even a condition known as \\novertraining syndrome. Overtraining \\nsyndrome is not well understood. However, \\nexperts agree that a decline in performance \\nresulting from psychological and \\nphysiological factors cannot be fixed by a \\nfew days’ rest. Instead, weeks, months, and \\nsometimes even years are required to \\novercome the symptoms of overtraining \\nsyndrome. Symptoms include the following: \\n \\n• weight loss  \\n• loss of motivation \\n• inability to concentrate or focus \\n• feelings of depression \\n• lack of enjoyment in activities \\nnormally considered enjoyable \\n• sleep disturbances \\n• change in appetite \\n \\n \\nReversibility \\n \\nChronic adaptations are not permanent. As \\nthe saying goes, “Use it or lose it.”  \\nThe principle of reversibility suggests that \\nactivity must continue at the same level to \\nkeep the same level of adaptation. As \\nactivity declines, called detraining, \\nadaptations will recede.  \\n \\nIn cardiorespiratory endurance, key areas, \\nsuch as VO\\n2max, stroke volume, and cardiac \\noutput all declined with detraining while \\nsubmaximal heat rate increased. In one \\nstudy, trained subjects were given bed rest \\nfor 20 days. At the end of the bed rest \\nphase, VO\\n2max had fallen by 27% and stroke \\nvolume and cardiac output had fallen by \\n25%. The most well-trained subjects in the \\nstudy had to train for nearly 40 days \\nfollowing bed rest to get back into pre-rest \\ncondition. In a study of collegiate \\nswimmers, lactic acid in the blood after a 2-\\nminute swim more than doubled after 4 \\nweeks of detraining, showing the ability to \\nbuffer lactic acid was dramatically affected.\\n2 \\n \\nNot only is endurance training affected, but \\nmuscular strength, muscular endurance, \\nand flexibility all show similar results after a \\nperiod of detraining.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='8 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nIndividual Differences \\n \\nWhile the principles of adaptation to stress \\ncan be applied to everyone, not everyone \\nresponds to stress in the same way. In the \\nHERITAGE Family study, families of 5 \\n(father, mother, and 3 children) \\nparticipated in a training program for 20 \\nweeks. They exercised 3 times per week, at \\n75% of their VO\\n2max, increasing their time to \\n50 minutes by the end of week 14. By the \\nend of the study, a wide variation in \\nresponses to the same exercise regimen \\nwas seen by individuals and families. Those \\nwho saw the most improvements saw \\nsimilar percentage improvements across \\nthe family and vice versa. Along with other \\nstudies, this has led researchers to believe \\nindividual differences in exercise response \\nare genetic. Some experts estimate genes \\nto contribute as much as 47% to the \\noutcome of training.  \\n \\nIn addition to genes, other factors can \\naffect the degree of adaptation, such as a \\nperson’s age, gender, and training status at \\nthe start of a program. As one might expect, \\nrapid improvement is experienced by those \\nwith a background that includes less \\ntraining, whereas those who are well \\ntrained improve at a slower rate.   \\n \\nActivity Guidelines \\n \\nBelow are links to the physical activity \\nguidelines provided by the US Department \\nof Health and Human Services and the \\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine \\n(ACSM). As you review these \\nrecommendations, notice how closely they \\nfollow the FITT pattern described earlier in \\nthe chapter.  \\n \\nNIH Recommendations for Physical Activity \\n \\nACSM Recommendations on Quantity and \\nQuality of Exercise \\n \\n \\nFitness Guidelines \\n \\nThe recommendations linked above pertain \\nto physical activity only. While they can be \\napplied to fitness, more specific guidelines \\nhave been set to develop fitness. As stated \\npreviously, physical activity is aimed at \\nimproving health; exercise is aimed at \\nimproving health and fitness. These \\nguidelines will be referenced often as each \\nhealth-related component of fitness is \\ndiscussed.  \\n \\n \\nCreating a Successful Fitness \\nPlan  \\n \\nOften, the hardest step in beginning a new \\nroutine is simply starting the new routine. \\nOld habits, insufficient motivation, lack of \\nsupport, and time constraints all represent \\ncommon challenges when attempting to \\nbegin a new exercise program. Success, in \\nthis case, is measured by a person’s ability \\nto consistently participate in a fitness \\nprogram and reap the fitness benefits \\nassociated with a long-term commitment.  \\n \\n \\nThink Lifestyle \\n \\nBeginning a fitness program is a daunting \\ntask. To illustrate the concept of lifestyle, \\nconsider attendance at fitness centers \\nduring the month of January. Attendance \\nincreases dramatically, driven by the \\nnumber 1 New Year’s resolution in America: \\nlosing weight. Unfortunately, as time'),\n",

By some estimates, as many as 80% \\nhave stopped coming by the second week in \\nFebruary. As February and March approach, \\nattendance continues to decline, eventually \\nfalling back to pre-January levels.  \\n \\nWhy does this occur? Why aren’t these new \\ncustomers able to persist and achieve their \\ngoal of a healthier, leaner body? One \\npossible explanation: patrons fail to view \\ntheir fitness program as a lifestyle. The \\nbeginning of a new year inspires people to \\nmake resolutions, set goals, as they envision \\na new and improved version of themselves. \\nUnfortunately, most of them expect this \\ntransformation to occur in a short period of \\ntime. When this does not happen, they \\nbecome discouraged and give up.  \\nReturning to teen level weight and/or \\nfitness may be an alluring, well-intended \\ngoal, but one that is simply unrealistic for \\nmost adults. The physical demands and \\ntime constraints of adulthood must be \\ntaken into consideration for any fitness \\nprogram to be successful. Otherwise, any \\nnew fitness program will soon be \\nabandoned and dreams of physical \\nperfection fade, at least until next January.  \\nLike any other lifestyle habit, optimal health \\nand fitness do not occur overnight. Time \\nand, more importantly, consistency, drive \\nsuccessful health and fitness outcomes. The \\nvery term lifestyle refers to changes that are \\nlong term and become incorporated into a \\nperson’s daily routine. Unlike many fad \\ndiets and quick fixes advertised on \\ntelevision, successful lifestyle changes are \\nalso balanced and reasonable. They do not \\nleave you feeling depressed and deprived \\nafter a few days. Find a balance between \\nwhat you want to achieve and what you are \\nrealistically able to do. Finally, you must do \\nmore than simply change your behaviors. \\nYou must also modify your mental \\nperception to promote long-term health. \\nFind a compelling reason for incorporating \\nhealthier behaviors into your daily routine.   \\nThe steps below will guide you through this \\nprocess. Before beginning a fitness \\nprogram, you should understand the safety \\nconcerns associated with exercise.  \\n \\nSafety First: Assessing Your Risk \\nThe physical challenges of beginning a new \\nexercise program increase the risk of injury, \\nillness, or even death. Results from various \\nstudies suggest vigorous activity increases \\nthe risk of acute cardiac heart attacks \\nand/or sudden cardiac death.\\n3 While that \\ncautionary information appears \\ncontradictory to the previously identified \\nbenefits of exercise, the long-term benefits \\nof exercise unequivocally outweigh its risks. \\nIn active young adults (younger than 35), \\nincidence of cardiac events are still rare, \\naffecting 1 in 133,000 in men and 1 in \\n769,000 in women. In older individuals, 1 in \\n18,000 experience a cardiac event. \\n4 \\n \\nOf those rare cardiac incidents that do \\noccur, the presence of preexisting heart \\ndisease is the common thread, specifically, \\natherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis causes \\narteries to harden and become clogged with \\nplaque, which can break apart, move to \\nother parts of the body, and clog smaller \\nblood vessels. As such, it is important to \\nscreen individuals for risk factors associated \\nwith heart disease before they begin an \\nexercise program.   \\n \\nThe American College of Sports Medicine \\nrecommends a thorough pre-screening to \\nidentify any risk of heart disease. The 7'),\n",

To get there, you \\nmust first determine your current location \\nand then find the roads that will take you to \\nyour desired location. You must also \\nconsider roads that will present the least \\namount of resistance, provide a reasonably \\ndirect route, and do not contain any safety \\nhazards along the way. Of course, planning \\nthe trip, while extremely important, is only \\nthe first step. To arrive at your destination, \\nyou must actually drive the route, \\nmonitoring your car for fuel and/or \\nmalfunction, and be prepared to reroute \\nshould obstacles arise.  \\nPreparing yourself for an exercise program \\nand ultimately, adopting a healthier \\nlifestyle, requires similar preparation. You \\nwill need to complete the following steps: \\n• Assess your current fitness \\nWhere are you on the map? \\n• Set goals \\nWhat is your destination’s location? \\n• Create a plan \\nWhat route will you choose? \\n• Follow through \\nStart driving! \\n \\n \\nAssess Your Condition \\n \\nTo adequately prepare, you will need to \\ntake a hard look at your current level of \\nfitness. With multiple methods of assessing \\nyour fitness, you should select the one that \\nmost closely applies to you. Obtaining a \\ngood estimate will provide you a one-time \\nglance at your baseline fitness and health \\nand provide a baseline measurement for \\ngauging the efficacy of your fitness program \\nin subsequent reassessments.  \\n \\nAssessments are specific to each health-\\nrelated component of fitness.

Take a look at the \\nwell-stated example below: \\nI will improve my 12-minute distance by \\n10% within 2 months of the first \\nassessment. \\nNote, all the ingredients of a well-stated \\ngoal are present. It is specific (improve 12-\\nminute distance by 10%), measurable (10% \\nimprovement), attainable and realistic (the \\ndegree of improvement is reasonable in \\nthat time frame), and includes a time frame \\n(a clear deadline of 2 months).  \\nLess effective goals would be stated like \\nthis:  \\n\\uf0d8 I will run farther next time I assess my \\nfitness.  \\n\\uf0d8 I want to jog faster. \\n\\uf0d8 I will lose weight \\nAnd a common one: \\n\\uf0d8 I will exercise 3 days a week at 60% max \\nheart rate for 45 minutes per session for \\n2 months.  \\nAt a closer glance, none of these examples \\ncontain all of the ingredients of a well-\\nstated goal. How can “faster” be measured? \\n“Farther” is not specific enough, nor is “lose \\nweight.” In the last example, this is not a \\ngoal at all. It is a plan to achieve a goal that \\nhas not been stated.  \\nIn the end, setting up well-stated goals will \\ngive you the best chance to convert good \\nintentions into a healthier lifestyle.  \\nTo complete this step, write down 2-3 \\npersonal goals, stated in the SMART format, \\nand put them in a place you will see them \\nfrequently.  \\n \\n \\nCreate a Plan \\n \\nOnce you know exactly what you want to \\nachieve, generate a strategy that will help \\nyou reach your goals.

If your goal is related to \\nweight loss, this should drive the frequency, \\nduration, and intensity of your daily \\nworkouts as these variables will influence \\nyour body’s use of fat for fuel and the \\nnumber of calories burned.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='13 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nneed to dedicate more workout time to \\nachieving those results.  \\nAnother key principle is the importance of \\nsafety. The importance of designing a \\nprogram that is safe and effective cannot be \\noverstated. You can minimize any risks by \\nrelying on the expert recommendations of \\nthe US Department of Health and Human \\nServices and the American College of Sports \\nMedicine previously outlined and linked \\nhere\\n. These highly reputable organizations \\nhave conducted extensive research to \\ndiscover the optimal frequency, intensity, \\nand duration for exercise.  \\n \\n \\nFollow Through \\n \\nOnce you have assessed your current \\nfitness levels, set goals using the SMART \\nguidelines, and created your personalized \\nfitness plan, you should feel very proud of \\nyourself! You have made significant \\nprogress toward achieving a healthier \\nlifestyle. Now is when the “rubber hits the \\nroad.”  (Literally so, if your plan includes \\nwalking or jogging.) Now that you have \\ninvested time and energy to develop a \\nthoughtful, well-designed fitness program, \\nit is time to reap the returns of good \\nexecution. The assessment, planning and \\npreparation are really the hardest parts. \\nOnce you know what to do and how to do \\nit, success is simply a matter of doing it.  \\n \\nUnfortunately, the ability to stick with a \\nprogram proves difficult for most. To \\nprevent getting derailed from your \\nprogram, identify barriers that may prevent \\nyou from consistently following through. \\nOne of the most common challenges cited \\nis a shortage of time. Work schedules, \\nschool, child care, and the activities of daily \\nliving can leave you with little time to \\npursue your goals. Make a list of the items \\nthat prevent you from regularly exercising \\nand then analyze your schedule and find a \\ntime for squeezing in your exercise routine. \\nRegardless of when you schedule your \\nexercise, be certain to exercise consistently. \\nBelow are a few additional tips for achieving \\nconsistency in your daily fitness program:    \\n\\uf0a7 Think long term; think lifestyle. \\nThe goal is to make exercise an \\nactivity you enjoy every day \\nthroughout your life. Cultivating a \\nlove for exercise will not occur \\novernight and developing your ideal \\nroutine will take time. Begin with \\nthis knowledge in mind and be \\npatient as you work through the \\nchallenges of making exercise a \\nconsistent part of your life.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Start out slowly. \\nAgain, you are in this for the long \\nhaul. No need to overdo it in the \\nfirst week. Plan for low intensity \\nactivity, for 2–3 days per week, and \\nfor realistic periods of time (20–30 \\nminutes per session).  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Begin with low Intensity/low volume. \\nAs fitness improves, you will want to \\ngradually increase your efforts in \\nterms of quantity and quality. You \\ncan do this with more time and \\nfrequency (called volume) or you \\ncan increase your intensity. In \\nbeginning a program, do not change \\nboth at the same time.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Keep track. \\nResults from a program often occur \\nslowly, subtly, and in a very anti-\\nclimactic way. As a result,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='14 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nparticipants become discouraged \\nwhen immediate improvements are \\nnot visible. Keeping track of your \\nconsistent efforts, body \\ncomposition, and fitness test results \\nand seeing those subtle \\nimprovements will encourage and \\nmotivate you to continue. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Seek support. \\nLook for friends, family members, \\nclubs, or even virtual support using \\napps and other online forums. \\nSupport is imperative as it provides \\nmotivation, accountability, \\nencouragement, and people who \\nshare a common interest, all of \\nwhich are factors in your ability to \\npersist in your fitness program. \\n  \\n\\uf0a7 Vary your activities from time to \\ntime. \\nYour overall goals are to be \\nconsistent, build your fitness, and \\nreap the health benefits associated \\nwith your fitness program. Varying \\nyour activities occasionally will \\nprevent boredom. Instead of \\nwalking, play basketball or ride a \\nbike. Vary the location of your \\nworkout by discovering new hiking \\ntrails, parks or walking paths. \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Have fun. \\nIf you enjoy your activities, you are \\nfar more likely to achieve a lasting \\nlifestyle change. While you cannot \\nexpect to be exhilarated about \\nexercising every day, you should not \\ndread your daily exercise regimen. If \\nyou do, consider varying your \\nactivities more, or finding a new \\nroutine you find more enjoyable. \\n  \\n\\uf0a7 Eat healthier. \\nNothing can be more frustrating \\nthan being consistent in your efforts \\nwithout seeing the results on the \\nscale. Eating a balanced diet will \\naccelerate your results and allow \\nyou to feel more successful \\nthroughout your activities.  \\n \\nAdditional Safety Concerns \\n \\nAs activity rates among Americans increase, \\nspecifically outdoor activities, safety \\nconcerns also rise. Unfortunately, the \\nphysical infrastructure of many American \\ncities does not accommodate active \\nlifestyles. Limited financial resources and \\nde-emphasis on public health means local \\nand state governments are unlikely to \\nallocate funds for building roads with \\nsidewalks, creating walking trails that \\nsurround parks, or adding bike lanes. In \\naddition, time constraints and \\ninconvenience make it challenging for \\nparticipants to travel to areas where these \\namenities are available. As a result, exercise \\nparticipants share roads and use isolated \\ntrails/pathways, inherently increasing the \\nsafety risks of being active.  \\nA key principle in outdoor safety is to \\nrecognize and avoid the extremes. For \\nexample, avoid roads that experience heavy \\ntraffic or are extremely isolated.  Avoid \\nheavy populated areas as well as places \\nwhere no one is around. Do not exercise in \\nthe early morning or late at night, during \\nextreme cold or extreme heat. To minimize \\nsafety risks during these types of \\nenvironmental conditions, do not use \\nheadphones that could prevent you from \\nhearing well and remaining alert, do not \\nexercise alone, prepare for adequate'),\n",

Always remember the \\npurpose of your exercise is for enjoyment \\nand improved health. If these objectives \\ncould be compromised by going for a run at \\nnoon in 95-degree heat, or lifting large \\namounts of weight without a spotter, you \\nshould reconsider your plan. Before \\nexercising in what could be risky conditions, \\nask yourself, “Is there a safer option \\navailable?” \\nLastly, be aware of the terrain and weather \\nconditions. Walking or jogging on trails is a \\nwonderful way to enjoy nature, but \\nexposed roots and rocks present a hazard \\nfor staying upright. Wet, muddy, or icy \\nconditions are additional variables to avoid \\nin order to complete your exercise session \\nwithout an accident.  \\nThe document linked below from the \\nUniversity of Texas at San Antonio Police \\nDepartment outlines specific safety tips that \\nwill help you stay safe in your activities.  \\nSafety Tips for Runners, Walkers, and \\nJoggers \\n \\n \\nEnvironmental Conditions \\n \\nWhen exercising outdoors, you must \\nconsider the elements and other factors \\nthat could place you at increased risk of \\ninjury or illness.  \\n \\nHeat-Related Illness \\n \\nHeat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, \\nheat exhaustion, and heat stroke, \\ncontributed to 7,233 deaths in the United \\nStates between 1999 and 2009. A 2013 \\nreport released by the Center for Disease \\nControl stated that about 658 deaths from \\nheat-related illnesses occurred every year \\nwhich account for more deaths than \\ntornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning \\ncombined. Of those deaths, most were \\nmale, older adults.8 \\n \\nThe number one risk factor associated with \\nheat-related illness is hydration, the starting \\npoint of all heat-related illness. \\nUnfortunately, sweat loss can occur at a \\nfaster rate than a person can replace with \\nfluids during exercise, especially at high \\nintensities. Even when trying to hydrate, \\ningestion of large amounts of fluids during \\nexercise can lead to stomach discomfort. \\nWhat does this mean? Hydration must \\nbegin before exercise and must become \\npart of your daily routine.  \\nSeveral practical methods of monitoring \\nhydration levels can assist in preventing \\nillness. One simple method, while not full \\nproof, is to simply monitor the color of your \\nurine. In a hydrated state, urination will \\noccur frequently (every 2–3 hours) and \\nurine will have very little color. In a \\ndehydrated state, urination occurs \\ninfrequently in low volume and will become \\nmore yellow in color.  \\nAnother simple method involves weighing \\nyourself before and after a workout (see \\nlab). This is a great way to see firsthand \\nhow much water weight is lost during an \\nexercise session primarily as a result of \\nsweat. Your goal is to maintain your pre- \\nand post-body weight by drinking fluids \\nduring and after the workout to restore'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='16 \\n Flynn | FITNESS PRINCIPLES \\nwhat was lost. This method, when \\ncombined with urine-monitoring, can \\nprovide a fairly accurate assessment of \\nhydration levels.   \\nThe best preventative measure for \\nmaintaining a hydrated state is simply \\ndrinking plenty of water throughout the \\nday. In previous years, recommendations \\nfor the amount of water to drink were a \\none size fits all of about 48–64 oz. per day, \\nper person. In an effort to individualize \\nhydration, experts now recommend basing \\nfluid intake on individual size, gender, \\nactivity levels, and climate. Generally, half \\nan ounce (fluid ounces) to 1 ounce per \\npound of body weight is recommended.\\n9 \\nFor a 150-pound individual, this would \\nmean 75–150 ounces of water per day! \\nWhile there is still considerable debate over \\nthe exact amounts, no one disputes the \\nimportance of continually monitoring your \\nhydration using one of the techniques \\ndescribed previously. Insufficient hydration \\nleads to poor performance, poor health, \\nand potentially serious illness.  \\nIt should be noted that electrolyte “sport” \\ndrinks, such as Gatorade and PowerAde, are \\noften used to maintain hydration. While \\nthey can be effective, these types of drinks \\nwere designed to replace electrolytes \\n(potassium, sodium, chloride) that are lost \\nthrough sweating during physical activity. In \\naddition, they contain carbohydrates to \\nassist in maintaining energy during activities \\nof long duration. If the activity planned is \\nshorter than 60 minutes in duration, water \\nis still the recommended fluid. For activities \\nbeyond 60 minutes, a sports drink should \\nbe used.  \\n \\n \\nCold-Related Illnesses \\n \\nMuch like extremely hot environmental \\nconditions, cold weather can create \\nconditions equally as dangerous if you fail \\nto take proper precautions. To minimize the \\nrisk of cold-related illness, you must \\nprevent the loss of too much body heat. \\nThe three major concerns related to cold-\\nrelated illnesses are hypothermia, frost-nip, \\nand frost bite.  \\n \\nAs with heat-related illness, the objective of \\npreventing cold-related illness is to \\nmaintain the proper body temperature of \\nbetween 98.6 and 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit. \\nIf body temperature falls below 98.6 F, \\nmultiple symptoms may appear, indicating \\nthe need to take action. Some of those \\nsymptoms include: \\n• shivering \\n• numbness and stiffness of joints and \\nappendages \\n• loss of dexterity and/or poor \\ncoordination \\n• peeling or blistering of skin, \\nespecially to exposed areas \\n• discoloration of the skin in the \\nextremities \\nWhen walking or jogging in the cold, it is \\nimportant to take the necessary steps to \\navoid problems that can arise from the \\nenvironmental conditions.  \\n• Hydration is key. \\nCold air is usually drier air, which \\nleads to moisture loss through \\nbreathing and evaporation. Staying \\nhydrated is key in maintaining blood \\nflow and regulating temperature.  \\n \\n• Stay dry. \\nHeat loss occurs 25x faster in water \\nthan on dry land. As such, keeping'),\n",

Therefore, the \\nkey point is to direct moisture \\n(sweat) away from the skin. This is \\ncontrolled most effectively by \\nlayering your clothing. A base layer \\nof moisture-wicking fabric should be \\nused against the skin while \\nadditional layers should be \\nbreathable. This will channel \\nmoisture away from the skin, and \\nany additional layers of clothing, \\nwithout it becoming saturated in \\nsweat. If exercising on a windy day, \\nuse clothing that protects from the \\nwind and is adjustable so you can \\nbreathe. \\n \\n• Cover the extremities.  \\nThose parts of the body farthest \\naway from the heart (toes, fingers, \\nand ears) tend to get coldest first. \\nTake the appropriate steps to cover \\nthose areas by using gloves, \\nmoisture-wicking socks, and a \\nwinter cap to cover your head.    \\n \\nTerminology Checklist \\nPhysical activity: any activity that requires \\nskeletal muscle and requires energy aimed \\nat improving health.  \\nExercise: a subset of physical activity that is \\nplanned and structured aimed at improving \\nfitness.  \\nHealth related components of fitness: \\ntypes of activities dedicated to improving \\nphysical fitness categorized as \\ncardiorespiratory endurance, muscular \\nstrength and endurance, flexibility, and \\nbody composition.  \\nSkills related components of fitness: types \\nof activities dedicated to improving physical \\nskills categorized as speed, agility, \\ncoordination, balance, power, and reaction \\ntime.  \\nPrinciples of adaptations to stress: \\nguidelines related to managing the \\napplication of stress during physical \\nactivity/exercise. \\nOverload Principle: a principle of \\nadaptation to stress suggesting the amount \\nof stress applied during exercise must \\nexceed a threshold level to stimulate \\nadaptation.  \\nVolume: the term used to describe “how \\nmuch” stress is being applied by combining \\nthe duration and frequency of exercise.   \\nProgression principle: a principle relating to \\nhow much additional stress that can safely \\nbe introduced to gradually improve fitness \\nwithout risking injury or overuse.  \\nSpecificity: the principle of stress \\nsuggesting activities should be closely \\ncentered around the primary outcome goal, \\ni.e. train the way you want to adapt.'),\n",

Everest, a challenging feat very few \\nhave accomplished. In the process, you \\ngradually ascend from base camp, which \\nsits at about 17,500 feet above sea level, to \\nthe peak at over 29,000 feet. At this \\nelevation, the pressure of oxygen is so low, \\nyou struggle to take in a satisfying breath. \\nAlthough you strive to breathe deeply, you \\nare unable to get enough air. Your heart \\nrate increases and you might even develop \\nnausea and a headache. Unless your body \\nhas a chance to acclimate itself to higher \\nelevations or you gain access to \\nsupplemental oxygen, your symptoms will \\npersist or worsen.  \\n \\nThese are the sensations many people with \\ncardiovascular or respiratory illnesses, such \\nas asthma, chronic bronchitis, or mild \\ncardiovascular disease, experience on a \\ndaily basis.

For \\nmost people, unless they engage in \\nstrenuous physical activity sufficient to get \\nthem breathing hard, their cardiovascular \\nand respiratory system (heart, blood \\nvessels, and lungs) operates efficiently \\nenough to go relatively unnoticed. \\nHowever, does that mean their \\ncardiorespiratory (CR) system is functioning \\nat optimal capacity?

Both oxygen and \\nnutrients, which are imperative for cellular \\nenergy production, must be taken in from \\nthe lungs and digestive system. Because the \\nheart and lungs are so interlocked in this \\nprocess, the two systems are often labeled \\ntogether as the cardiorespiratory system. \\nWithout a healthy respiratory system, the \\nbody would struggle to bring in enough \\noxygen, release carbon dioxide (the \\nchemical waste product of cellular \\nmetabolism) and eliminate unwanted \\nparticles that enter the respiratory tract \\nwhen inhaling. Without a healthy heart, \\ntransporting oxygen from the lungs and \\nnutrients from the digestive system to the \\nbody’s cells would be impossible. If the \\nhealth of the CR system were compromised \\nenough, survival would be impossible. \\nAdditionally, both must be healthy or the \\nfunction of one or the other will be \\ncompromised.  \\n \\nBelow are several videos explaining how the \\ncardiovascular and respiratory systems \\noperate and function together: \\n \\n• The CR System and Exercise\\n \\n \\n• How the Cardiovascular System \\nWorks \\n \\n• Respiratory System Explained in \\nDetail \\n \\n \\nThe CR System and Energy \\nProduction \\n \\nClearly the cardiovascular and respiratory \\nsystems function as one, but why is the CR \\nsystem so important? What makes the \\ndistribution of oxygen throughout the body \\nso vital to existence? The answer is simple: \\nENERGY. While oxygen in and of itself does \\nnot contain any energy (calories), it does \\ncombine with fuel extracted from food once \\nit has been introduced into the cell to help \\nproduce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP \\nis the basic form of cellular energy found in \\nthe body. Because the body stores very \\nlittle ATP, it must constantly be \\nregenerated. For this reason, people must \\ncontinue eating and breathing to live.  \\n \\nWithin the context of fitness, the purpose \\nof the cardiorespiratory system is not only \\nto produce energy but to also adapt in a \\nway so that energy production can be \\noptimized. For example, a high school cross \\ncountry runner wants to be fit enough to \\ncompete in the state cross country meet. \\nUnfortunately, this athlete’s current mile \\ntimes are 6 minutes per mile. In other \\nwords, that is the maximum work rate \\npossible for this athlete. However, the goal \\nis to improve to 5 minutes per mile, or \\nimprove the maximum work rate. To do so, \\nmore energy must be produced. According \\nto the principles of adaptation, it is possible \\nfor this athlete to become more efficient at \\nproducing energy, enabling him to run a'),\n",

An example of this \\nadaptation comes from the world record \\nmile time of 3 minutes and 43 seconds. The \\nworld record marathon time (26.2 miles) is \\n2 hours, 2 minutes, and 52 seconds. That \\nequates to 4 minutes and 41 seconds per \\nmile over the 26-mile course. That is some \\nserious ATP production! \\n \\n \\nOxidative Energy System \\n(Aerobic) \\n \\nAs oxygen and nutrients are delivered to \\nthe cells, they are utilized to produce ATP. \\nThe workhorses of the cell for oxidative \\nmetabolism are the mitochondria. This \\nform of energy production is contingent on \\nthe ability of the CR system to deliver \\noxygen and nutrients and the cell’s ability to \\nprocess that oxygen. Because of the \\nimportance of oxygen in this particular \\nenergy-producing pathway, it is called the \\noxidative energy system, or aerobic system.  \\n \\nOxidative energy production is the primary \\nmeans of ATP production during rest and \\nfor activities that last for 2 minutes or \\nlonger. Although other forms of energy \\nproduction assist in ATP production at any \\ngiven time, long duration exercise sessions \\nrely on this aerobic pathway. Also, in \\ncontrast to other forms of ATP production, \\nthe oxidative energy system uses both \\ncarbohydrates and fats for fuel sources.  \\n \\nTo consider: What activities would \\nemphasize development of this energy \\npathway?   \\n \\n \\n \\nImmediate/Explosive Energy \\nSystem \\n \\nWhile the oxidative system is the primary \\nsource of ATP production, it does require a \\nfew minutes for the system to begin \\noperating at full capacity during exercise. \\nHow then could the body immediately \\nproduce enough energy to perform a \\nstrenuous activity, such as sprinting 50 \\nmeters? Clearly, another energy system \\nmust drive ATP production. The immediate \\nor explosive energy system utilizes the \\nstorage of creatine phosphate (CP) and the \\nstorage of adenosine diphosphate, which is \\nstored in very small amounts, to generate \\nATP. When needed, this energy system \\nprovides enough ATP to sustain a short-\\nduration, explosive activity, approximately \\n10–20 seconds or less. Once CP is depleted, \\nother energy systems must assist in the ATP \\ngenerating process.  \\n \\n \\nNon-Oxidative or Anaerobic \\nEnergy System  \\n \\nAs the name implies, the non-oxidative \\nenergy system does not require oxygen to \\ngenerate ATP. Instead, the cells where the \\nATP is produced require glucose \\n(carbohydrates that have been broken \\ndown) as the fuel source. Like the \\nimmediate energy system, this system is \\nassociated with high intensity and short \\nduration movements.

The result \\nof excessive lactic acid accumulation \\ncontributes to muscle fatigue, making it \\nimpossible to continue exercise at a high \\nintensity.  \\n \\n \\nEnergy Systems Combine \\n \\nIt is important to understand that energy \\nsystems do not operate in a compartmental \\nfashion, but rather operate simultaneously, \\neach carrying some of the burden of ATP \\nproduction. For example, a professional \\nsoccer player would spend most of the \\nmatch “cruising” at a light/moderate \\nintensity level, thus primarily utilizing the \\noxidative energy system. However, during \\nthe match, he or she may sprint for several \\nhundred meters, utilizing the explosive and \\nnon-oxidative system, or he or she may \\njump, requiring use of the explosive system. \\nThus, both energy systems are utilized \\nsimultaneously throughout the match. To \\nimprove performance, this player would \\nneed to develop the energy system which is \\nutilized the most during the match.  \\n \\n \\nChanges in the CR System \\n \\nAn improvement in CR functioning, or \\nfitness level, requires adaptation of the \\nsystem. Remember, the point is to more \\neffectively generate ATP so more work can \\nbe accomplished. In order to process more \\noxygen and deliver more oxygenated blood \\nto the cells, the overall system must \\nundergo changes to make this possible. \\nHere is a list of adaptations that occur to \\nthe CR system as a result of consistent \\naerobic exercise:  \\n \\n• Resting heart rate may decrease. \\nThe average resting heart rate \\nhovers around 70–75 beats per \\nminute. Elite athletes may have \\nresting heart rates in the high 30s. \\nGenerally, resting heart rate may \\ndecrease by approximately 10 beats \\nper minute with chronic exercise.  \\n• Pulmonary adaptations, such as \\nincreased tidal volume (the amount \\nof oxygen entering the lungs with \\neach breath) and increased diffusion \\ncapacity (the amount of oxygen that \\nenters the blood stream from the \\nlungs). This allows for more oxygen \\nto enter the pulmonary circulation \\nen route to the left side of the heart.  \\n• The heart muscles, specifically the \\nleft side of the heart, increase in size \\nmaking it possible to contract more \\nforcefully. As a result, more blood \\ncan be pumped with each beat \\nmeaning more oxygen can be routed \\nto the systemic circulation.  \\n• More oxygen is delivered and \\ntransported into the cells where ATP \\nproduction can occur. This is called \\nthe arterial-vein difference (a-\\nVO\\n2diff) \\n \\nThese changes in the system are not \\npermanent because of a process known as \\nthe principle of reversibility. Following a \\nperiod of inactivity, the benefits from \\nchronic aerobic exercise will be reversed.'),\n",

Each of the \\nwalking/jogging assessments discussed here \\nattempts to estimate a key physiological \\nmarker of the heart’s and lungs’ functioning \\ncapacity and maximal oxygen consumption. \\nMaximal oxygen consumption, or VO2 max, \\nmeasures the body’s maximum ability to \\ntake in and utilize oxygen, which directly \\ncorrelates to overall health and fitness. A \\ngood estimate of VO\\n2 max provides a one-\\ntime glance at a person’s health and fitness \\nlevel and a baseline measurement for \\nreassessment at future dates to gauge \\nimprovements.  \\n \\nSome of the most common walking/jogging \\nassessments used to estimate VO2 max \\ninclude the 12-Minute Walk, 1.5-Mile \\nRun/Walk Test, 3-Minute Step Test, and 1-\\nMile Walk Test. Unfortunately, these field \\nassessments, although practical and \\ninexpensive, only provide estimations. \\nMore accurate assessments require a lab-\\nbased VO2max test using equipment that \\nmeasures the volume of oxygen and carbon \\ndioxide being moved in and out of the air \\npassages during exercise. Although this test \\nis more accurate, the expense and \\navailability make it impractical for most. \\nUnlike the lab test, the field assessments \\nare relatively cost free, user-friendly and \\nrequire very little expertise to conduct or \\nperform. In addition, the key point of the \\nassessment is measuring differences rather \\nthan absolute values, and the field tests \\naccurately meet that objective.  \\nInformation on how to safely perform these \\nassessments will be provided at the end of \\nthis chapter.  \\n \\n \\nMeasuring Heart Rate \\n \\nThose starting the VO\\n2max assessments must \\nfirst measure their heart rate, an important  \\ncomponent used in the calculations.  \\n \\nHere is a video describing how to determine \\nheart rate: \\n \\n• How to check your pulse\\n \\n \\n \\nCreating a Plan to Develop \\nCR Fitness \\n \\nOnce the assessments have been \\ncompleted, the next step is to develop a \\nplan for maintaining or improving your \\ncurrent level of fitness.

Once \\nthese fitness goals have been identified, the \\nprinciples of adaptation to change can be \\nutilized to achieve those goals. These \\nprinciples include specificity, targeting \\nspecific areas in a workout, and overload, \\nthe practice of increasing exertion as the \\nbody adapts to ensure continued gains in \\nfitness levels. Specifically, you need to apply \\nthe FITT principle (Fitness, Intensity, Time, \\nand Type) described in detail in the \\nprevious chapter, “Fitness Principles”:  \\n \\n• Frequency: 3–5 days per week for \\nhealthy adults.  \\n• Intensity: moderate to vigorous \\nintensity, which equals 40–85% of'),\n",

Engaging in a “cardio” \\nprogram that does not stress the CR system \\nto the recommended levels will be \\nineffective. Engaging in a program that \\noverstresses the system can lead to injury \\nand pose unnecessary risks. So how do you \\nknow if you are in the right range?  \\n \\nHeart rate is one of the best ways to \\nmeasure effort level. Walking and jogging \\nincrease a person’s heart rate. Based on the \\nfunction of the heart, this is no surprise. \\nThe heart rate directly correlates with the \\namount of oxygen being taken in by the \\nlungs. As activity increases in intensity, \\noxygen demands increase and so does heart \\nrate.  \\n \\nBecause of this relationship, heart rate can \\nbe used in the design of an effective \\nwalking and jogging program by creating \\ntarget heart rate zones. Heart rate zones \\nrepresent an intensity range—a low end \\nheart rate and a high end rate—within \\nwhich a person’s heart rate would fall \\nduring a walking or jogging session.  \\n \\nThe first step in determining your target \\nheart rate (THR), is to determine your \\nmaximum heart rate (MHR), both \\nmeasured in beats per minute (bpm). \\nGenerally, MHR is estimated to be your age \\nsubtracted from 220 beats per minute. In \\nother words, your heart rate should \\ntheoretically stop increasing once it reaches \\nthe calculated maximum. While helpful, it is \\nnot uncommon to see variances in the \\nlaboratory tested maximum heart rate \\nversus the calculated method. \\n \\nThe next step in calculating THR is to \\ncalculate a specific percentage of your \\nMHR. This is done using two different \\nmethods. Keep in mind, finding the THR is \\nthe objective in both methods, even though \\nslightly different numbers are used. \\n \\nThe first method, called Max Heart Rate \\nMethod, is more commonly used.  \\n \\nMax Heart Rate Method \\n1. Calculate MHR;  \\nMHR = 220 – age.  \\n2. Calculate high and low THR by \\nplugging in a percentage range.

By keeping the heart rate \\nwithin that range, you will drive adaptation \\nspecific to that intensity. By using real, but \\nrandom numbers, and plugging them into \\nthe above equation this becomes apparent.  \\n \\nFemale, aged 20: \\n \\n1. MHR = 220 -20 \\nMHR = 200 bpm;  \\n2. THR\\nlow = 200 x .60 \\nTHRlow = 120 bpm \\nTHRhigh =200 x .80 \\nTHRhigh = 160 bpm \\n3. THR = 120 - 160 bpm \\n \\nTo achieve her self-established goals, the \\nfemale in the example above will need to \\nstay within the range of 120 and 160 bpm. If \\nher efforts are intense enough that she \\nbegins to exceed 160 bpm during her \\nsession, or easy enough that her heart rate \\nfalls below 120 bpm, she would need to \\nchange her intensity mid-session to get the \\noptimal results.  \\n \\nThe Karvonen Formula or Heart Rate \\nReserve Method \\n \\n1. Calculate MHR; MHR = 220 – age. \\n2. Determine your resting heart rate \\n(RHR).   \\n3. Find the heart rate reserve (HRR); \\nHRR = MHR – RHR \\n4. Calculate high and low THR by \\nplugging in a percentage range and \\nthen adding in the RHR. In this \\nexample, 60 and 80% are being \\nused. \\nTHR\\nlow = HRR x .60 + RHR \\nTHRhigh = HRR x .80 + RHR \\n5. The resulting low and high THR \\nnumbers represent the range, or \\ntarget intensity.  \\nClearly, the Karvonen formula requires a \\nfew more steps, specifically, the \\nincorporation of the resting heart rate. \\nUsing the same female in the example \\nabove, along with a randomly selected RHR, \\nthe THR looks like this: \\n \\n1. MHR = 220 – 20 \\nMHR = 200 \\n2. RHR = 72 bpm (randomly selected) \\n3. HRR = MHR – RHR \\nHRR = 200 – 72 \\nHRR = 128 \\n4. THR\\nlow = HRR x .60 + RHR \\nTHRlow = 128 x .60 + 72 \\nTHRlow = 149 bpm \\nTHRhigh = HRR x .80 + RHR \\nTHRhigh = 128 x .80 + 72 \\nTHRhigh = 174 bpm \\n5. THR = 149 – 174 bpm \\n \\nA comparison of the two methods, reveals \\nthat the low and high end of the Karvonen \\nformula is much higher than the Max Heart \\nRate method, even though the exact same \\npercentages have been used. If the female \\nin this example used the Karvonen Formula, \\nshe would find herself at a much higher \\nintensity, especially at the low end of the \\nrange (120 vs. 149 bpm). How can this be? \\nAren’t these formulas supposed to have the \\nsame objective?  \\n \\nWhile it is true that both equations are used \\nto estimate a target heart rate range, only \\nthe Karvonen Formula takes into account \\nthe RHR, the lowest possible heart rate that \\ncan be measured for that individual. The \\nMax Heart Rate method assumes the lowest \\nheart rate possible is “0,” a number to be \\navoided if at all possible! Because of the \\ndifference between 0 and the maximum \\nheart rate, the calculated percentages \\nresult in a much lower number. In terms of'),\n",

The \\nmethod is as simple as asking the question, \\nOverall, how hard do I feel I am working? \\nThe answer is given based on a scale of 6 to \\n20 with 6 being almost no effort and 20 \\nbeing maximum effort. Studies have \\nindicated that when subjects are asked to \\nexercise at a moderate or heavy intensity \\nlevel, subjects can accurately do so, even \\nwithout seeing their heart rate. As a result, \\nusing the RPE scale can be an effective way \\nof managing intensity.  \\n \\nThe original RPE scale or Borg Scale, \\ndesigned by Dr. Gunnar Borg, was \\ndeveloped to mimic generalized heart rate \\npatterns. The starting and ending point of \\nthe scale are less intuitive than a typical \\nscale of 1-10. By design, the 6 represents a \\nresting heart rate of 60 bpm and the 20 an \\nexercise heart rate of 200 bpm, a beat \\ncount someone might experience at \\nmaximum effort. Over time, a modified \\nBorg Scale was developed using a simple 1–\\n10 scale, with 1 being resting effort and 10 \\nbeing maximum effort. Even though the \\nmodified scale is more intuitive, the \\ntraditional scale is still used more \\nfrequently.  \\n \\nWalking and jogging not only benefit \\nphysical health, but many enjoy the social \\nbenefits realized by exercising with friends. \\nWhen walking or jogging with friends, \\nintensity can easily be measured by \\nmonitoring your ability to carry on a \\nconversation. With the Talk Test, if you are \\nonly able to say short phrases or give one \\nword responses when attempting to \\nconverse during an exercise session, this \\nwould suggest you are working at a high \\nenough intensity that your breathing rate \\nmakes conversation difficult. Certainly, if \\nyou can speak in full sentences without \\ngetting winded, the intensity would be very \\nlight. Just like RPE, the Talk Test is yet \\nanother way to subjectively measure \\nintensity, which can then be correlated with \\nheart rates.  \\n \\n \\nCardiorespiratory Fitness \\nAssessment \\n \\nFollow the link below to the course lab in \\nwhich you will be assessing your current \\nlevel of cardiorespiratory fitness.

Skeletal \\nmuscles are made up of a number \\nof muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber is an \\nindividual muscle cell and may be anywhere \\nfrom 1 mm to 4 cm in length. When we \\nchoose to contract a muscle fiber—for \\ninstance we contract our bicep to bend our \\narm upwards—a signal is sent from our \\nbrain via the spinal cord to the muscle. This \\nsignals the muscle fibers to contract. Each \\nnerve will control a certain number of \\nmuscle fibers. The nerve and the fibers it \\ncontrols are called a motor unit. Only a \\nsmall number of muscle fibers will contract \\nto bend one of our limbs, but if we wish to \\nlift a heavy weight then many more muscles \\nfibers will be recruited to perform the \\naction. This is called muscle fiber \\nrecruitment. \\n \\nEach muscle fiber is surrounded by \\nconnective tissue called an external \\nlamina. A group of muscle fibers are \\nencased within more connective tissue \\ncalled the endomysium. The group of \\nmuscle fibers and the endomysium are \\nsurrounded by more connective tissue \\ncalled the perimysium.  A group of muscle \\nfibers surrounded by the perimysium is \\ncalled a muscle fasciculus.  A muscle is \\nmade up of many muscle fasciculi, which \\nare surrounded by a thick collagenous layer \\nof connective tissue called the epimysium.  \\nThe epimysium covers the whole surface of \\nthe muscle. \\n \\nMuscle fibers also contain many \\nmitochondria, which are energy \\npowerhouses that are responsible for the \\naerobic production of energy molecules, or \\nATP molecules. Muscle fibers also contain \\nglycogen granules as a stored energy \\nsource, and myofibrils, which are threadlike \\nstructures running the length of the muscle \\nfiber. Myofibrils are made up of two types \\nof protein: 1) Actin myofilaments, and \\n2) myosin myofilaments. The actin and \\nmyosin filaments form the contractile part \\nof the muscle, which is called \\nthe sarcomere. Myosin filaments are thick \\nand dark when compared with actin \\nfilaments, which are much thinner and \\nlighter in appearance. The actin and myosin \\nfilaments lie on top of one another; it is this \\narrangement of the filaments that gives \\nmuscle its striated or striped appearance. \\nWhen groups of actin and myosin filaments \\nare bound together by connective tissue \\nthey make the myofibrils. When groups of \\nmyofibrils are bound together by \\nconnective tissue, they make up muscle \\nfibers. \\n \\nThe ends of the muscle connect to bone \\nthrough a tendon. The muscle is connected \\nto two bones in order to allow movement \\nto occur through a joint. When a muscle \\ncontracts, only one of these bones will \\nmove. The point where the muscle is \\nattached to a bone that moves is called \\nthe insertion. The point where the muscle is \\nattached to a bone that remains in a fixed \\nposition is called the origin.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Muscular Strength and Endurance  3 \\n \\nHow Muscles Contract \\n \\nMuscles are believed to contract through a \\nprocess called the Sliding Filament Theory. \\nIn this theory, the muscles contract when \\nactin filaments slide over myosin filaments \\nresulting in a shortening of the length of the \\nsarcomeres, and hence, a shortening of the \\nmuscle fibers. During this process the actin \\nand myosin filaments do not change length \\nwhen muscles contract, but instead they \\nslide past each other. \\n \\nDuring this process the muscle fiber \\nbecomes shorter and fatter in appearance. \\nAs a number of muscle fibers shorten at the \\nsame time, the whole muscle contracts and \\ncauses the tendon to pull on the bone it \\nattaches to. This creates movement that \\noccurs at the point of insertion. \\n \\nFor the muscle to return to normal (i.e., to \\nlengthen), a force must be applied to the \\nmuscle to cause the muscle fibers to \\nlengthen. This force can be due to gravity or \\ndue to the contraction of an opposing \\nmuscle group.  \\n \\nSkeletal muscles contract in response to an \\nelectric signal called an action potential. \\nAction potentials are conducted along \\nnerve cells before reaching the muscle \\nfibers. The nerve cells regulate the function \\nof skeletal muscles by controlling the \\nnumber of action potentials that are \\nproduced. The action potentials trigger a \\nseries of chemical reactions that result in \\nthe contraction of a muscle. \\n \\nWhen a nerve impulse stimulates a motor \\nunit within a muscle, all of the muscle fibers \\ncontrolled by that motor unit will contract. \\nWhen stimulated, these muscle fibers \\ncontract on an all-or-nothing basis. The all-\\nor-nothing principle means that muscle \\nfibers either contract maximally along their \\nlength or not at all. Therefore, when \\nstimulated, muscle fibers contract to their \\nmaximum level and when not stimulated \\nthere is no contraction. In this way, the \\nforce generated by a muscle is not \\nregulated by the level of contraction by \\nindividual fibers, but rather it is due to the \\nnumber of muscle fibers that are recruited \\nto contract. This is called muscle fiber \\nrecruitment. When lifting a light object, \\nsuch as a book, only a small number of \\nmuscle fibers will be recruited. However, \\nthose that are recruited will contract to \\ntheir maximum level. When lifting a heavier \\nweight, many more muscle fibers will be \\nrecruited to contract maximally. \\n \\nWhen one muscle contracts, another \\nopposing muscle will relax. In this way, \\nmuscles are arranged in pairs. An example \\nis when you bend your arm at the elbow: \\nyou contract your bicep muscle and relax \\nyour tricep muscle. This is the same for \\nevery movement in the body. There will \\nalways be one contracting muscle and one \\nrelaxing muscle. If you take a moment to \\nthink about these simple movements, it will \\nsoon become obvious that unless the \\nopposing muscle is relaxed, it will have a \\nnegative effect on the force generated by \\nthe contracting muscle.  \\n \\nA muscle that contracts, and is the main \\nmuscle group responsible for the \\nmovement, is called the agonist or prime \\nmover. The muscle that relaxes is called \\nthe antagonist. One of the effects that \\nregular strength training has is an \\nimprovement in the level of relaxation that \\noccurs in the opposing muscle group. \\nAlthough the agonist/antagonist \\nrelationship changes, depending on which'),\n",

This may be referred to \\nas the lowering or negative phase. \\n \\n \\nMuscle Fiber Types \\n \\nNot all muscle fibers are the same. In fact, \\nthere are two main types of muscle fiber: \\n \\n• Type I \\nOften called slow-twitch or highly-\\noxidative muscle fibers \\n \\n• Type II  \\nOften called fast-twitch or low-\\noxidative muscle fibers'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Muscular Strength and Endurance  5 \\n \\nAdditionally, Type II muscle fibers can be \\nfurther split into Type IIa and Type IIb.  \\nType IIb fibers are the truly fast twitch \\nfibers, whereas Type IIa are in between \\nslow and fast twitch. Surprisingly, the \\ncharacteristics of Type IIa fibers can be \\nstrongly influenced by the type of training \\nundertaken. Following a period of \\nendurance training, they will start to \\nstrongly resemble Type I fibers, but \\nfollowing a period of strength training they \\nwill start to strongly resemble Type IIb \\nfibers. In fact, following several years of \\nendurance training they may end up being \\nalmost identical to slow-twitch muscle \\nfibers. \\n \\n \\nType I (Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers) \\n \\nSlow-twitch muscle fibers contain more \\nmitochondria, the organelles that produce \\naerobic energy. They are also smaller, have \\nbetter blood supply, contract more slowly, \\nand are more fatigue resistant than their \\nfast-twitch brothers. Slow-twitch muscle \\nfibers produce energy, primarily, through \\naerobic metabolism of fats and \\ncarbohydrates. The accelerated rate of \\naerobic metabolism is enhanced by the \\nlarge numbers of mitochondria and the \\nenhanced blood supply. They also contain \\nlarge amounts of myoglobin, a pigment \\nsimilar to hemoglobin that also stores \\noxygen. The myoglobin provides an \\nadditional store of oxygen for when oxygen \\nsupply is limited. This extra oxygen, along \\nwith the slow-twitch muscle fibers’ slow \\nrate of contraction, increases their \\nendurance capacity and enhances their \\nfatigue resistance.  Slow-twitch muscle \\nfibers are recruited during continuous \\nexercise at low to moderate levels. \\n \\nType IIb (Fast-Twitch Low-oxidative \\nMuscle Fibers) \\n \\nThese fibers are larger in size, have a \\ndecreased blood supply, have smaller \\nmitochondria and less of them, contract \\nmore rapidly, and are more adapted to \\nproduce energy anaerobically (without the \\nneed for oxygen) than slow-twitch muscle \\nfibers. Their reduced rate of blood supply, \\ntogether with their larger size and fewer \\nmitochondria, makes them less able to \\nproduce energy aerobically, and are \\ntherefore, not well suited to prolonged \\nexercise. However, their faster rate of \\ncontraction, greater levels of glycogen, and \\nability to produce much greater amounts of \\nenergy anaerobically make them much \\nmore suited to short bursts of energy. \\nBecause of their greater speed of \\ncontraction and reduced blood supply, they \\nare far less fatigue resistant than slow-\\ntwitch fibers, and they tire quickly during \\nexercise. \\n \\n \\nNumbers of Slow and Fast-Twitch \\nFibers \\n \\nThe number of slow and fast-twitch fibers \\ncontained in the body varies greatly \\nbetween individuals and is determined by a \\nperson’s genetics. People who do well at \\nendurance sports tend to have a higher \\nnumber of slow-twitch fibers, whereas \\npeople who are better at sprint events tend \\nto have higher numbers of fast-twitch \\nmuscle fibers. Both the slow twitch and \\nfast-twitch fibers can be influenced by \\ntraining. It is possible through sprint \\ntraining to improve the power generated by \\nslow twitch fibers, and through endurance \\ntraining, it is possible to increase the'),\n",

The \\nlevel of improvement varies, depending on \\nthe individual, and training can never make \\nslow-twitch fibers as powerful as fast-\\ntwitch, nor can training make fast-twitch \\nfibers as fatigue resistant as slow-twitch \\nfibers. \\n \\n \\nCardiac Muscle Structure and \\nFunction \\n \\nCardiac muscle cells are only found in the \\nheart. They are elongated and contain actin \\nand myosin filaments, which form \\nsarcomeres; these join end to end to form \\nmyofibrils. The actin and myosin filaments \\ngive cardiac muscle a striated appearance. \\nThe striations are less numerous than in \\nskeletal muscle. Cardiac muscles contain \\nhigh numbers of mitochondria, which \\nproduce energy through aerobic \\nmetabolism. An extensive capillary network \\nof tiny blood vessels supply oxygen to the \\ncardiac muscle cells. Unlike the skeletal \\nmuscle cells, the cardiac cells all work as \\none unit, all contracting at the same time. \\nIn short, the sinoatrial node at the top of \\nthe heart sends an impulse to the \\natrioventricular node, which sends a wave \\nof polarization that travels from one heart \\ncell to another causing them all to contract \\nat the same time. \\n \\n \\nSmooth Muscle Structure and Function \\n \\nSmooth muscle cells are variable in function \\nand perform numerous roles within the \\nbody. They are spindle shaped and smaller \\nthan skeletal muscle and contain fewer \\nactin and myosin filaments. The actin and \\nmyosin filaments are not organized into \\nsarcomeres, so smooth muscles do not have \\na striated appearance. Unlike other muscle \\ntypes, smooth muscle can apply a constant \\ntension. This is called smooth muscle \\ntone.  Smooth muscle cells have a similar \\nmetabolism to skeletal muscle, producing \\nmost of their energy aerobically. As such, \\nthey are not well adapted to producing \\nenergy anaerobically.\\n1 \\n \\nFor more information on muscle physiology, \\nclick on the links below: \\n \\nSkeletal Muscle Physiology\\n \\n \\nFast Twitch versus Slow Twitch\\n \\n \\n \\nActin and Myosin: the Romeo and Juliet of \\nMuscle Cells \\n \\nSkeletal Muscles\\n \\n \\nResistan ce Exercise \\nPrograming  \\n \\nDesigning a resistance exercise program can \\nseem like a daunting task.

While these \\ntypes of resistance training are not new, \\nthey could be unique sources of resistance \\nthat you have not considered in your quest \\nto add muscle to your frame. Using these \\nforms of resistance alone, in combination \\nwith one another, or in combination with \\nthe more traditional resistance apparatus, \\ncan enable you to diversify your efforts to \\nproduce valuable and improved results.  \\n \\nIn each type of training, you may use an \\napparatus to create an environment for \\nresistance. The uniqueness of these sources \\nis found in the way they are implemented. \\nYou might use a dumbbell for a particular \\nexercise in some of these alternative \\nresistance methods, but the way you use \\nthe resistance through a range of motion \\nmay be altogether different.  \\n \\n• Dynamic Constant Training  \\nAs the name suggests, the most \\ndistinctive feature of dynamic \\nconstant training (DCT) is that the \\nresistance is constant. A good \\nexample of DCT occurs when you \\nuse free weights or machines that \\ndo not alter resistance, but redirect \\nit instead. The emphasis shifts to \\ndifferent planes along the muscle \\ngroup being worked. When you \\nwork on a shoulder-press machine, \\nfor example, the resistance remains \\nconstant over the entire range of \\nmotion. It is identical from the \\nbottom of the movement to the top \\nand back down again. Only the \\ndirection of the resistance varies. \\nThe resistance redirects itself \\nthrough the arc and then redirects \\nitself again when the shoulders let \\nthe weight come back down to the \\nstarting position.  \\n \\n• Dynamic Progressive Training \\nIn dynamic progressive training \\n(DPT), resistance increases \\nprogressively as you continue to \\nexercise. DPT is often used as a \\nrehabilitative measure and offers \\nthe sort of resistance that builds \\ngradually while remaining \\ncompletely within the control of the \\nperson using it. Equipment includes \\nrubber bands and tubing, springs, \\nand an apparatus controlled by \\nspring-loaded parts. They are low-\\ncost items that are easily accessible \\nand can be used anywhere. Though'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content=\"Muscular Strength and Endurance  10 \\n \\ncommonly employed for \\nrehabilitation of torn ligaments, \\njoints, muscles, and broken bones, it \\nis also convenient for travelers on \\neither vacation or business trips. \\nWhen combined with traditional \\nforms of resistance, this training \\ncreates a better-balanced program \\nand provides the muscles with a \\nwelcome alternative from time to \\ntime.  \\n \\n• Dynamic Variable Training  \\nThis form of resistance exercise \\ntakes up where dynamic constant \\ntraining leaves off. Whereas DCT \\nemploys constant resistance, never \\nvarying to accommodate the body's \\nmechanics, DVT can be adapted to \\nthe varying degrees of strength of a \\nmuscle group throughout a range of \\nmotion. Though very few machines \\nsucceed in this goal, a few have \\ncome close.  \\n \\nHammer Strength equipment \\nemphasizes common fixed areas of \\nresistance. However, the Strive line \\nof equipment has been able to give \\nthe user much more choice in \\nresistance levels during an exercise. \\nStrive equipment uses the DVT \\nprinciple most effectively because it \\nallows the user to increase \\nresistance at the beginning, middle \\nor end of the range of motion. If \\nyour joints are stronger at the end \\nof a movement (the top) or the \\nbeginning (the bottom), you can set \\nthe resistance accordingly. The \\nStrive line is the most flexible yet of \\nall gym equipment designed to \\nadhere to the DVT principle. It lets \\nyou tailor-make your workouts \\nbased on your body's mechanics.  \\n \\n• Isokinetic Training \\nIn isokinetic training (IKT), the \\nmuscle is contracted at a constant \\ntempo. Speed determines the \\nnature of this resistance training, \\nnot the resistance itself; however, \\nthe training is based on movement \\ncarried out during a condition of \\nresistance. IKT can be performed \\nwith the body's own weight. \\n \\nIn isokinetic training, resistance is \\nsteady while velocity remains \\nconstant. For example, isokinetics \\nare at work with any machine that is \\nhydraulically operated. The \\nopposing forces mirror each other \\nthroughout the range of motion. A \\ngood example would be pressing \\ndown for triceps on a hydraulic \\nmachine and having to immediately \\npull up (the resistance is constant in \\nboth directions) into a biceps curl \\nwhile maintaining the same speed. \\nIKT often involves opposing body \\nparts. Trainers can use a variety of \\napparatus with their clients to \\nachieve isokinetic stasis between \\nmuscle groups. \\n \\n• Isometric Training \\nFamiliar to most people, isometric \\ntraining (IMT) is an excellent way to \\nbuild strength with little adverse \\neffect on joints and tendons \\ncommonly associated with strength \\ntraining and lifting heavy weights. \\nThough it appears simple in \\ncomparison to traditional resistance \\ntraining, IMT should not be \\nunderrated in its effectiveness. IMT \\nis a method in which the force of\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Muscular Strength and Endurance  11 \\n \\ncontraction is equal to the force of \\nresistance. The muscle neither \\nlengthens nor shortens. You may be \\nwondering how any training occurs \\nwithout lengthening and shortening \\nthe muscles. In IMT, the muscles act \\nagainst each other or against an \\nimmovable object.  \\n \\nIsometric training is what you see \\nswimmers do when they press their \\nhands against a solid wall, forcing all \\ntheir bodyweight into the wall. \\nAnother common IMT exercise is \\npressing the hands together to \\nstrengthen the pectorals and biceps. \\nPressing against the wall can involve \\nmuscles in the front deltoid, chest \\nand biceps. Isometric training has \\nbeen proven very effective for \\ngaining strength, but this method \\nusually strengthens only the muscles \\nat the point of the isometric \\ncontraction. If the greatest \\nresistance and force are acting upon \\nthe mid-portion of the biceps, that is \\nwhere most of the benefit will \\noccur. A comprehensive isometric \\nroutine can serve to increase \\nstrength in certain body parts.  \\n \\n• Isotonic Training \\nThis method demands constant \\ntension, typically with free weights. \\nThough this approach may sound a \\nlot like dynamic constant training, it \\ndiffers because it does not \\nnecessarily redirect the resistance \\nthrough a range of motion, but \\nrather, keeps tension constant as in \\nthe negative portion of an exercise. \\nComplete immobility of the muscle \\nbeing worked is required. For \\nexample, in the preacher curl, the \\nbiceps are fixed against the bench. \\nThey lift (positive), then release the \\nweight slowly downward (negative), \\nkeeping the same tension on the \\nmuscles in both directions. This is \\none reason that free-weight exercise \\nis considered the best form of \\nisotonic training. Merely lifting a \\ndumbbell or barbell, however, is not \\nnecessarily enough to qualify as \\nisotonic. The true essence of \\nisotonic training is keeping \\nresistance constant in both the \\npositive and negative portions of \\neach repetition.  \\n \\nExercise Order for Resistance \\nTraining \\n \\nThe general guidelines for exercise order \\nwhen training all major muscle groups in a \\nworkout is as follows: \\n \\n• Large muscle group exercises (i.e., \\nsquat) should be performed before \\nsmaller muscle group exercises (i.e., \\nshoulder press). \\n \\n• Multiple-joint exercises should be \\nperformed before single-joint \\nexercises. \\n \\n• For power training, total body \\nexercises (from most to least \\ncomplex) should be performed \\nbefore basic strength exercises. For \\nexample, the most complex \\nexercises are the snatch (because \\nthe bar must be moved the greatest \\ndistance) and related lifts, followed \\nby cleans and presses. These take \\nprecedence over exercises such as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Muscular Strength and Endurance  12 \\n \\nthe bench press and squat. \\n \\n• Alternating between upper and \\nlower body exercises or opposing \\n(agonist–antagonist relationship) \\nexercises can allow some muscles to \\nrest while the opposite muscle \\ngroups are trained. This sequencing \\nstrategy is beneficial for maintaining \\nhigh training intensities and \\ntargeting repetition numbers. \\n \\n• Some exercises that target different \\nmuscle groups can be staggered \\nbetween sets of other exercises to \\nincrease workout efficiency. For \\nexample, a trunk exercise can be \\nperformed between sets of the \\nbench press. Because different \\nmuscle groups are stressed, no \\nadditional fatigue would be induced \\nprior to performing the bench press. \\nThis is especially effective when long \\nrest intervals are used.\\n3 \\n \\n \\nResistance Training Conclusion \\n \\nThe most effective type of resistance-\\ntraining routine employs a variety of \\ntechniques to create a workout program \\nthat is complete and runs the gamut, from \\nbasic to specialized.

That does not mean that these \\ntraining methods will help everybody to win \\ncompetitions, but they will help you learn \\nhow to tune in to your body and \\nunderstand its functions through resistance \\nand movement.

Flexibility relates to \\nthe ability to move a joint through its full \\nrange of motion (ROM). Developing a \\ncomplete fitness program requires taking \\ntime to emphasize this component by \\nstretching. Unfortunately, as the American \\nCouncil on Exercise points out, “Most \\npeople neglect flexibility training, limiting \\nfreedom of movement, physical and mental \\nrelaxation, release of muscle tension and \\nsoreness, and injury prevention.”\\n1 \\n \\nPerhaps the reason it is so easy for people \\nto overlook flexibility is because its benefits, \\nwhile significant, are felt more than seen. \\nHowever, failing to address this component \\nof fitness can have serious consequences, \\nespecially as a person ages. Without \\nflexibility, everyday tasks, such as sweeping \\nthe floor or even getting out of bed, \\nbecome difficult. A reduced mobility of \\njoints increases the risk of injury during an \\nexercise routine, as well as the risk of \\noccasional and chronic back pain. This \\nchapter will provide a greater \\nunderstanding of this vitally important \\ncomponent of a complete fitness program \\nand demonstrate why flexibility shouldn’t \\nbe overlooked.  \\n \\nTypes of Flexibility \\n \\nFlexibility is classified into two types: static \\nand dynamic.  \\n \\n• Static flexibility \\nThis type of flexibility is a measure \\nof the limits of a joint’s overall range \\nof motion. It is measured by \\nstretching and holding a joint in the \\nposition of its maximum range while \\nusing a measuring instrument to \\nquantify that range. To achieve the \\nmaximum range, passive forces, the \\nforce generated from an external \\nsource, are required.  \\n \\n• Dynamic flexibility \\nThis type of flexibility is a measure \\nof overall joint stiffness during \\nmovement. Unlike static flexibility, \\ndynamic flexibility requires active \\nforce production, or your own \\nmuscles contracting. Because \\nquantifying “stiffness,” is difficult, \\ndynamic flexibility is measured more \\nsubjectively. Assessment is based on'),\n",

The definition of normal in \\nthis context is one developed from \\npopulation studies that measured \\nvarious areas of the body and \\nestablished an average degree of \\nmovement for a particular joint.  \\n \\n \\nBenefits of F lexibility and \\nStretching  \\n \\nRegular stretching provides many benefits, \\nthe most important of which is simple: \\nflexibility provides freedom of movement \\nand the ability to complete activities with \\ngreater ease.  \\n \\n \\nHealthy Joints and Pain \\nManagement  \\n \\nAs many as 26 percent of all adults report \\npain and stiffness in joints. That number \\nincreases dramatically with age, and \\nwomen are more likely to develop joint \\nsymptoms.2 For adults, arthritis is one of \\nthe most common conditions, with 54% of \\npeople 75 years and older having been \\ndiagnosed with arthritis.\\n3 Regular exercise, \\nincluding regular stretching, is essential for \\npeople with arthritis to maintain function \\nand manage joint pain. Even for those not \\naffected by joint conditions, stretching \\nincreases joint mobility and function, and \\ndecreases joint stiffness and pain.  \\n \\nImbalances in the muscles can cause \\ndiscomfort and pain. For example, if the \\nfront of a person’s thighs and hips gets too \\ntight from a lack of flexibility, the tension \\nwill pull on the hips, where the muscles are \\nattached. The result is the pelvis may be \\npulled forward and cause greater sway in \\nyour lower back. This affects posture and \\ncan eventually lead to pain and stiffness in \\nthe neck, shoulders, and lower back. \\nStretching all major muscle groups and joint \\nareas regularly promotes good alignment \\nand balance.  \\n \\n \\nMuscle Relaxation and Stress Relief  \\n \\nStaying in one position for long periods of \\ntime, repetitive movements, and other \\neveryday stressors can result in stiff \\nmuscles and knots, also called trigger \\npoints. Regular stretching decreases \\nanxiety, blood pressure, and breathing rate, \\nwhich help to relax muscles and aches and \\npains related to neuromuscular tension \\n(stress). Flexibility has also been prescribed \\nsuccessfully to treat dysmenorrhea, which is \\npainful menstruation. It also relieves muscle \\ncramps that can occur during exercise or \\nparticipation in sports.  \\n \\n \\nOther Benefits  \\n \\nIn addition to the benefits listed above, \\nresearch has documented additional \\nbenefits that provide good reasons for \\nmaintaining a routine of stretching:'),\n",

For \\nyoung adults, bending over to tie their \\nshoes is painless. Walking around campus \\nwith a backpack requires minimal effort. \\nHowever, ROM declines with age. Simple \\nactivities like rotating the head and neck to \\nglance over the shoulders, getting in and \\nout of a vehicle, or carrying groceries can \\nbecome painful. Therefore, flexibility is \\ncritical in maintaining a high quality of life \\nthroughout the aging process.  \\n \\n \\nThe Inactivity -Mobility Cycle  \\n \\nAnyone who has suffered an injury and had \\nto wear a splint, cast, or brace to \\nimmobilize a joint knows how important \\nmobility is to overall health. Unfortunately, \\nwhen the joints’ ROM becomes restricted \\nby arthritis or other injuries, activity \\ndeclines. As activity declines, the ROM \\ncontinues to diminish as a result of \\ninactivity, and a vicious cycle ensues. A \\nsimple stretching program can help \\nalleviate this problem and break the cycle.   \\n \\n \\nImproving Range of Motion  \\n \\nJoint ROM results from a combination of \\nfactors, which are classified as either \\ninternal or external. Internal structures \\nrelate to the physical structures of body \\nmaterials and tissue. External factors are \\nnon-structural and include gender, age, \\nexcess fat mass, muscle mass, \\nenvironmental temperature, and \\nrestrictions in clothing or equipment.  \\n \\nInternal factors include joint structure/joint \\nmechanics and the connective and soft \\ntissue surrounding the joint. Because \\nmuscular actions, such as muscular \\ncontractions and stretching, are controlled \\nby the nervous system, another internal \\nfactor can be attributed to the \\nneuromuscular system and how the \\nstretching and tension is managed.  \\n \\n \\nJoint Structure  \\n \\nA joint is defined as a location on the \\nskeletal system where two or more bones \\nintersect and interact. For example, the \\nhumerus (upper arm) intersects with the \\nradius and ulna (lower arm) at the point of \\nthe elbow. The bony formation of each joint \\nstructurally limits its ROM. For example, the \\nshoulder joint, which is structurally a ball-'),\n",

As a result, little can be done to \\nimprove flexibility in this area.  \\n \\nNot only is range of motion related to the \\njoint structure, but flexibility exercises are \\njoint-specific. Stretching the hamstring will \\nnot improve flexibility in the shoulders. \\nLikewise, flexibility in the shoulders may be \\nexcellent while fingers or ankles remain \\n“stiff.” As such, a complete and effective \\nstretching program includes multiple \\nstretches for various joints.  \\n \\n \\nConnective and Muscle Tissue  \\n \\nJoints are surrounded and connected by \\nmuscles, tendons, ligaments, and skin. The \\nhead of the humerus fits into a small cavity \\nto create the shoulder joint. However, \\nthose bones cannot remain in that position \\nwithout the muscles, tendons, and \\nligaments that keep the joint tight and hold \\nit in place. In addition, muscle tissue is \\nsurrounded with connective tissue, \\nprimarily collagen and elastin. As a joint \\nmoves through its normal range of motion, \\nall of this soft tissue must stretch to \\naccommodate the movement. Therefore, \\nstatic and dynamic flexibility is probably \\nmost limited by the flexibility of the \\nsurrounding soft tissue, specifically the \\nconnective tissue. \\n \\nWhile the exact biomechanics of how \\nflexibility is changed is not well understood, \\nthey do appear to be related to the elastic \\nand plastic properties of the connective \\ntissue. Elasticity is defined as the ability to \\nreturn to resting length after passive \\nstretching (i.e., elastic recoil). Like a spring, \\nsoft tissues stretch and then recoil to their \\nresting position. Plasticity is the tendency \\nto assume a greater length after passive \\nstretching (i.e., plastic deformation). \\nStretching that spring composed of soft \\ntissues will change its resting position to a \\nnew longer length. The goal of a flexibility \\nprogram is to repeatedly overload the \\nelastic properties of the muscle to elicit \\nplastic deformation over time. Experts \\nsuggest that a slow, sustained stretch for \\n30–90 seconds is necessary to produce \\nchronic plastic deformation.  \\n \\n \\nNeuromuscular System  \\n \\nModern cars come equipped with a central \\ncomputer and sensors to troubleshoot \\nproblems with the vehicle. Sensors in the \\nengine monitor temperature. Sensors on \\nthe wheels gauge tire pressure while \\nsensors in the gas tank alert the driver \\nwhen fuel is low. Much like a car, our \\nbodies are equipped with sensors, called \\nproprioceptors, that help us manage \\nmovement and prevent injury.  \\n \\nMuscles have two specific types of \\nproprioceptors that determine the length \\nand tension of the muscle. These'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Flexibility  5 \\n \\nproprioceptors are called muscle spindles \\nand Golgi tendon organs (GTOs).  \\n \\nMuscles spindles lie parallel to the regular \\nmuscle and help determine the length of \\nmuscles when they are being stretched. \\nWhen a muscle is stretched, it sends signals \\nto the central nervous system causing the \\nstretched muscle to contract. This \\nresistance to the stretch, called the \\nmyotatic or stretch reflex is generated by \\nthe nervous system’s reflexive stimulus sent \\nto the stretching muscle. That same signal \\nalso causes the antagonist, or opposing \\nmuscle to relax, called reciprocal inhibition. \\nAs such, when the upper thigh (quadriceps) \\nare stretched, the hamstrings (antagonist to \\nthe quadriceps) relax.  \\n \\nThe GTOs are located near the \\nmusculotendon junction, the end points of \\nthe muscle, and relay messages to the \\ncentral nervous system regarding muscle \\nlengthening and tension of the muscle. \\nWhen activated, these signals will override \\nthe stretch reflex causing a sudden \\nrelaxation of the stretching muscle. This is \\ncalled autogenic inhibition or the inverse \\nmyotatic reflex. This inhibitory reflex can \\nonly occur after the muscle has been \\nstretched for 5 seconds or longer. This is \\nwhy, to effectively stretch, movements \\nmust be sustained for long, slow increments \\nof time. Otherwise, the resistance \\nencountered from the stretch reflex will not \\nbe overridden and lengthening cannot \\noccur. Whether signaling the muscles to \\ncontract or relax, the neuromuscular \\nsystem manipulates the stretched muscle, \\npresumably as a protective mechanism to \\nprevent injury.  \\n \\n \\nImproving Flexibility  \\n \\nResearch has identified multiple stretching \\ntechniques that aid in improving ROM. \\nRegardless of the specific technique or \\nspecific mode used, each technique can be \\nperformed using either active or passive \\nmode. Active stretching, also called \\nunassisted stretching, is done individually \\nwithout an external stimulus. Passive \\nstretching, or assisted stretching, is when a \\npartner or trainer is used as the stimulus in \\nthe stretching exercise. Both modes are \\neffective and can be applied to each of the \\ntechniques described below.  \\n \\n \\nStatic Stretching  \\n \\nThe technique most commonly prescribed \\nand used to improve flexibility is the static \\nstretch. A static stretch involves slow, \\ngradual, and controlled movements. The \\nmuscle group is stretched toward the end \\nof the joint’s ROM until the point of mild \\ndiscomfort is reached. Once that point is \\nreached, the stretch is held in a “static” \\nposition for 30 to 90 seconds. After the \\nprescribed time, the stretch can be \\nrepeated. Common ways in which static \\nstretching is applied would be performing \\nYoga routines or stretching after a workout \\nor an athletic event. Some of the major \\nadvantages of static stretching are as \\nfollows: 1) It is generally considered safe \\n(see Stretches to Avoid\\n); 2) It is simple to \\nperform; and 3) It is effective at increasing \\nROM. The only major disadvantage comes \\nfrom doing it too much, which can reduce \\nstrength and may make joints unstable. Of'),\n",

This type of stretching involves \\ndynamic movements like those done by \\nathletes during sports events. In that \\nregard, ballistic stretching is seen as being \\nvery specific to and beneficial for athletes. \\nHowever, one criticism of ballistic stretching \\nis that because of the short duration of the \\nstretch and the forceful nature of ballistic \\nmovements, the muscular contraction from \\nthe stretch reflex may cause muscle \\nsoreness or even injury. For that reason, \\nmany coaches regard ballistic stretching as \\nunsafe. Also, many researchers contend \\nthat it is less effective at improving ROM. \\nNonetheless, the American College of \\nSports Medicine (ACSM) still recommends \\nballistic stretching as one method to \\neffectively increase flexibility.  \\n \\n \\nDynamic Stretching  \\n \\nBallistic stretching is a form of dynamic \\nstretching. However, when referring to \\ndynamic stretching routines, most fitness \\nprofessionals are referring to dynamic \\nmovements that do not involve forceful \\nbouncing motions. Instead, dynamic \\nstretching, in this context, suggests \\nperforming exaggerated sports movements \\nin a slower, more controlled manner. For \\nexample, a sprinter may use several \\nexaggerated stride lengths before a race to \\nimprove hip ROM.  \\n \\nAn advantage of dynamic stretching is its \\nability to target and improve dynamic \\nflexibility, which in turn may improve \\nperformance. A disadvantage comes from \\nthe movements involved, which often \\nrequire good balance and coordination. \\nSince mastering the correct form requires \\ntime and a certain level of athleticism, \\ndynamic stretching may not be suitable for \\ncertain populations.  \\n \\n \\nProprioceptive Neuromuscular \\nFacilitation (PNF) Stretching \\n \\nThis type of exercise usually involves a \\npartner. The partner will passively stretch \\nthe person’s muscle. This movement is \\nimmediately followed by an isometric \\nmuscle contraction against resistance. This \\ncontraction is then followed by another \\npassive stretch. This type of stretch is also \\nnamed contract-relax stretch because of \\nthe sequence of movements involved. \\nOther types of PNF stretching involve \\ncontract-relax-antagonist contraction, also \\ndescribing the sequence of movements \\ninvolved but adding an additional step. \\n \\nAs the name of the technique implies, PNF \\nstretching emphasizes the natural \\ninteraction of the proprioceptors with the \\nmuscles to increase the ROM during the \\nstretch. Remember that during the stretch, \\nthe muscle spindles cause two responses: \\nthe stretch reflex and the reciprocal \\ninhibition (the relaxing of the antagonist \\nmuscle). After 5 seconds, the GTOs then \\noverride the muscle spindle’s signals'),\n",

Because the \\nmuscle is relaxed, it can be stretched more \\neasily. To reiterate, the stretch either uses \\nthe activity of the antagonist muscle to get \\nthe target muscle to relax or the target \\nmuscle itself relaxes as a result of the \\ncontraction of the antagonist muscle. \\n \\nWhile many experts assert that PNF \\nstretching is the most effective technique, \\nstudies that compare static and PNF \\nstretching are inconclusive. Regardless, it \\ndoes appear to be very effective at \\nincreasing static flexibility. Some \\ndisadvantages to PNF are that it generally \\nrequires a knowledgeable partner, it is \\nsomewhat complicated, and it can cause \\nsoreness as a result of the contractions.  \\n \\n \\nCreating an Effective \\nStretching Program \\n \\nThe ACSM has made specific \\nrecommendations on how to design a \\nflexibility program (click here\\n to view). \\nHowever, before examining these \\nrecommendations in depth, you should first \\nevaluate your current flexibility status by \\nassessing various joints’ ROM. Specifically, \\nperforming the sit-and-reach test will assess \\nyour hamstring and lower back flexibility \\nwhile using a goniometer can be used to \\nassess your ankles, knees, hips, neck and \\nshoulders. Instructions on how to perform \\nthese assessments will follow later.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSetting Goals \\n \\nOnce you determine which of your joints \\nare the most and least flexible, you can set \\nsome realistic goals to improve or maintain \\nyour ROM. Be specific when you set goals. \\nInstead of just saying, “I want to increase \\nmy flexibility,” identify the specific area of \\nthe body you intend to improve. You will \\nalso want to make sure your goal can be \\nmeasured. A better way to state your goal \\nis, “I will improve my sit-and-reach score by \\n4 cm by the end of the semester.” Notice \\nthis goal, as stated, includes a specific area, \\nis measurable, and includes a deadline. By \\nstating your goal properly, you will increase \\nthe likelihood of achieving it.  \\n \\n \\nApplying the FITT Principle  \\n \\nAs mentioned previously, the ACSM has \\nmade recommendations for designing a \\nflexibility program based on the FITT \\nPrinciple (Frequency, Intensity, Time and \\nType). As the ACSM recommends, your \\nflexibility program should include multiple \\nstretching exercises that target all major \\njoints, including the neck, shoulders, \\nelbows, wrists, trunk, hips, knees, and \\nankles. \\n \\n \\nAfter selecting your exercises, follow the \\nrecommendations below when performing \\nyour routine: \\n  \\n• Frequency  \\nStretch a minimum of 2-3 days per \\nweek, ideally 5-7 days per week.'),\n",

Complete two to four \\nrepetitions of each stretch.  \\n \\n• Type (mode ) \\nSelect the technique that best suits \\nyour circumstances: static, dynamic, \\nballistic, or proprioceptive \\nneuromuscular facilitation.  \\n \\n \\nWhen to Stretch  \\n \\nAlthough stretching can be done any time, \\nthe ACSM traditionally recommends that \\nflexibility training be incorporated into the \\nwarm up or cool down phase of an exercise \\nsession. Recent studies suggests that \\nstretching before an exercise session will \\ncompromise the force-producing \\ncapabilities of muscles and should be \\navoided. Therefore, it is recommended that \\nstretching be restricted to after the warm-\\nup or workout, when the temperature of \\nthe body and muscles has increased. \\nAdditional evidence pertaining to this \\nconcept shows that applying heat packs for \\n20 minutes to increase muscle temperature \\ncan increase hamstring flexibility more so \\nthan 30 seconds of static stretching. These \\nfindings confirm that temperature also \\nplays a significant role in muscle ROM.  \\n \\nAdditional information about improving \\nyour flexibility and balance can be found by \\nclicking on the link below: \\n \\nImproving Flexibility and Balance\\n \\n \\n \\nStretching Safely  \\n \\nIn addition to warming up your muscles \\nbefore performing stretching exercises, \\nadditional precautions can be taken to \\nensure the safety of your routine. When \\nmuscles are stretched quickly and \\nforcefully, the stretch reflex can be \\nactivated. This creates significant tension \\nbecause the muscle fibers will not only be \\nstretching but also attempting to contract. \\nAs mentioned previously, this is one of the \\nreasons ballistic stretching may not be \\nsuitable for everyone. To avoid this, stretch \\nslowly and in a controlled fashion while \\nholding the stretch for 10 seconds or more. \\n \\n \\nStretches to Avoid  \\n \\nResearch indicates that some stretches are \\ncontraindicated, which means they are not \\nrecommended because they provide little \\nto no benefit and may cause injury.

It is needed for healthy cellular \\nfunction, energy, cushioning for vital \\norgans, insulation, and for food flavor.  \\n \\nFat storage in the body consists of two \\ntypes of fat: essential and nonessential fat. \\nEssential fat is the minimal amount of fat \\nnecessary for normal physiological function. \\nFor males and females, essential fat values \\nare typically considered to be 3% and 12%, \\nrespectively. Fat above the minimal amount \\nis referred to as nonessential fat. It is \\ngenerally accepted that an overall range of \\n10-22 percent for men and 20-32 percent \\nfor women is considered satisfactory for \\ngood health. A body composition within the \\nrecommended range suggests a person has \\nless risk of developing obesity-related \\ndiseases, such as diabetes, high blood \\npressure, and even some cancers.\\n \\n \\nA woman’s essential fat range is naturally \\ngreater than a man’s because of fat \\ndeposits in breasts, uterus and sex-specific \\nsites. In both males and females, non-\\nessential fat reserves can be healthy, \\nespecially in providing substantial amounts \\nof energy. \\n \\n \\nExcessive body fat is categorized by the \\nterms overweight and obesity. These terms \\ndo not implicate social status or physical \\nattractiveness, but rather indicate health \\nrisks. Overweight is defined as the \\naccumulation of non-essential body fat to \\nthe point that it adversely affects health. \\nAccording to the American College of Sports \\nMedicine (ACSM), the threshold for being \\ncharacterized as overweight is having a \\nbody composition of FM greater than 32% \\nand 19% for females and males, aged 20-39, \\nrespectively.\\n3 \\n \\nObesity is characterized by excessive \\naccumulation of body fat and can be'),\n",

Several \\nothers are listed below.  \\n \\n• Performance of physical activity \\nAn important component of a \\nhealthy lifestyle and weight \\nmanagement is regular physical \\nactivity and exercise. To the \\ncontrary, those who live a sedentary \\nlifestyle will find it more difficult to \\nmaintain a healthy body weight or \\ndevelop adequate musculature, \\nendurance, and flexibility. \\nUnfortunately, additional body \\nweight makes it more difficult to be \\nactive because it requires more \\nenergy and places a higher demand \\non weak muscles and the \\ncardiovascular system. The result is \\na self-perpetuating cycle of inactivity \\nleading to more body weight, which \\nleads to more inactivity.  \\n  \\n• Emotional wellness \\nStudies indicate obesity is associated \\nwith a 25% increase in anxiety and \\nmood disorders, regardless of age or \\ngender. Other studies suggest \\nincreases in BMI significantly \\nincrease the incidence of personality \\ndisorders and anxiety and mood \\ndisorders. Additional studies have \\nbeen able to associate a higher \\nincidence of psychological disorders \\nand suicidal tendencies in obese \\nfemales compared with obese \\nmales.\\n5 \\n \\n• Pre-mature death \\nThe association between obesity \\nand diseases, such as cancer, CVD, \\nand diabetes, suggests that people \\nwith more body fat generally have \\nshorter lifespans. The Center for \\nDisease Control (CDC) estimates up \\nto 365,000 deaths each year can be \\nlinked with obesity, representing \\nnearly 15% of all deaths. Other \\nstudies have tied the Years of Life \\nLost to body mass index \\nmeasurements, estimating \\nanywhere from 2 to 20 years can be \\nlost, depending on ethnicity, age at \\ntime of obese classification, and \\ngender.\\n6 \\n \\n• Economic impact \\nThe physical harm caused by obesity \\nand overweight is mirrored by its \\neconomic impact on the health care \\nsystem. The CDC has estimated the \\nmedical costs to be about $147 \\nbillion in 2008, which includes \\npreventative, diagnostic, and \\ntreatments.

However, the presence of \\nunwanted body fat is not the only concern \\nassociated with an unhealthy weight. \\nWhere the fat is stored, or fat distribution, \\nalso affects overall health risks.  \\n  \\nNon-essential fat is primarily stored in \\nadipose tissue, or fat cells, located on the \\nsurface of the body and surrounding the \\nbody’s organs. Surface fat, located just \\nbelow the skin, is called subcutaneous fat. \\nFat that lies deeper in the body surrounding \\nthe body’s organs is called visceral fat. \\nUnlike subcutaneous fat, visceral fat is more \\noften associated with abdominal fat. \\nResearchers have found that excessive belly \\nfat decreases insulin sensitivity, making it \\neasier to develop type II diabetes. It may \\nalso negatively impact blood lipid \\nmetabolism, contributing to more cases of \\ncardiovascular disease and stroke in \\npatients with excessive belly fat.\\n8  \\n \\nBody fat distribution can easily be \\ndetermined by simply looking in the mirror. \\nThe outline of the body, or body shape, \\nwould indicate the location of where body \\nfat is stored. Abdominal fat storage patterns \\nare generally compared to the shape of an \\napple, called the android shape. This shape \\nis more commonly found in males and post-\\nmenopausal females.

This \\nshape may be connected to females’ child-\\nbearing abilities as enzymes associated with \\nfat-storage and mobilization are activated \\nduring certain times of pregnancy and post-\\npartum.  \\n \\nBesides looking in the mirror to determine \\nbody shape, people can use an inexpensive \\ntape measure to measure the diameter of \\ntheir hips and waist. Many leading \\norganizations and experts currently believe \\na waist circumference of 40 or greater for \\nmales and 35 or greater for females \\nsignificantly increases risk of disease.\\n9  \\n \\nIn addition to measuring waist \\ncircumference, measuring the waist and the \\nhips and using a waist-to-hip ratio (waist \\ncircumference divided by the hip \\ncircumference) is equally effective at \\npredicting body fat-related health \\noutcomes. According to the National Heart, \\nLung, and Blood Institute, a ratio of greater \\nthan 0.82 for females and 0.94 for males is \\nassociated with a higher risk of developing \\nheart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. \\n10 \\n \\n \\nBody Mass Index \\n \\nIn addition to body composition and \\nwaist/hip circumferences, measuring body \\nmass has also been used as an effective \\nmethod to assess health risks. Body mass \\nindex (BMI) is a measurement of'),\n",

For \\nexample, based on the BMI scale, a female \\nwith a height of 5’6” should not weigh more \\nthan 155 lbs. If her weight exceeded 155 \\nlbs., she would be categorized as \\n“overweight.”  \\n \\nWeight (kg) \\nHeight (m2) \\n \\nAmong several criticisms, the BMI method \\nhas been faulted for not distinguishing \\nbetween FM and FFM, since only the overall \\nweight is taken into account. For athletes, \\nwho may be more massive as a result of \\nlarger muscles, this criticism holds true. For \\nexample, a professional football player who \\nweighs 215 pounds and stands at 6’3” \\nwould have the exact same BMI as a \\nrelatively sedentary arm-chair quarterback \\nwho also weighs 215 pounds with the same \\nheight. This discrepancy also exists when \\napplying BMI to the senior population. As \\nage increases, muscle mass declines. \\nSeniors who have experienced years of \\nmuscle mass decline but increased body fat \\nmay maintain a constant weight despite \\nhaving a very different body composition.  \\n \\nOther criticisms of using BMI as a health risk \\nassessment tool include its failure to take \\nage or gender into account. As discussed \\npreviously, females naturally have more \\nbody fat yet are classified in the same \\ncontext as males. Because this \\nmeasurement is so widely used by \\nphysicians, patients continue to express \\nconcerns about the validity of BMI as an \\nindication of fatness.  \\n \\nRegardless of the criticisms, BMI as used for \\nthe general population, has been shown to \\nbe a reasonable predictor of health \\noutcomes. At its core, it is not intended to \\nbe an estimate of body composition, i.e., \\nmeasure FM and FFM. Instead, it is \\nintended to be used as an estimate of \\nhealthy/unhealthy levels of body fat. When \\nused as a means of tracking weight changes \\nover time it can be a valuable tool in \\npredicting health and for recommending \\nlifestyle modifications.\\n11  \\n \\n \\nHow to Measure Body \\nComposition \\n \\nMultiple methods exist to estimate body \\ncomposition. Remember, body composition \\nis the ration of FM and FFM used to help \\ndetermine health risks. Of the other \\nmethods already mentioned (waist, waist-\\nto-hip ratio, and BMI), none provide \\nestimates of body composition but do \\nprovide measurements of other weight-\\nrelated health markers, such as abdominal \\nfat. Experts have designed several methods \\nto estimate body composition. While they \\nare not flawless, they do provide a fairly \\naccurate representation of body \\ncomposition. The most common are:  \\n \\n• Hydrostatic Weighing (Underwater \\nWeighing) \\nAt one time, hydrostatic weighing \\n(also and maybe more accurately \\ncalled hydrodensitometry) was \\nconsidered the criterion for \\nmeasuring body composition. Many \\nother methods are founded on this \\nmodel, in one form or another. This \\nmethod attempts to measure the \\ndensity of the body by applying \\nArchimedes’ principle:  \\nBMI ='),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='6 \\nFlynn | BODY COMPOSITION \\ndensity = mass/volume. The mass \\nand volume components are \\nmeasured by using dry weight and \\nthen weight while being submerged \\nin a water tank. Since fat is less \\ndense than muscle tissue, a person \\nwith more body fat will weigh less in \\nthe water than a similar person with \\nmore lean mass. Using the \\nmeasurements, the density can be \\ndetermined and converted into body \\nfat percentage. With a small margin \\nof error (around 1-2%) this method \\nis very accurate. Unfortunately, the \\nexpense and practicality of building \\nand maintaining a water tank limits \\naccess for most. Also, for those with \\na fear of water, this would obviously \\nnot be the preferred method.  \\n \\n• Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry \\n(DEXA) \\nReplacing underwater weighing as \\nthe new “gold standard,” is DEXA. \\nWhile underwater weighing \\naccurately compartmentalizes FM \\nand FFM, DEXA adds a third \\ncompartment by using low-radiation \\nX-rays to distinguish bone mineral. \\nThis addition slightly increases the \\naccuracy of DEXA by eliminating \\nsome of the guess work associated \\nwith individual differences, such as \\ntotal body water and bone mineral \\ndensity.  \\n \\nOriginally, DEXA scanners were \\ndesigned to determine and help \\ndiagnose bone density diseases. As a \\nresult, they can be found in many \\nphysicians’ offices. However, a full \\nbody scan, which takes only a few \\nminutes, is all that is needed to also \\ndetermine body fat percentage.  \\n \\nMajor disadvantages to this method \\nare its high cost and the need for a \\nwell-trained professional to operate \\nthe equipment and analyze the \\nresults.  \\n \\n• Air Displacement (Plethysmography) \\nA good alternative to more \\nexpensive methods, air \\ndisplacement determines body \\ndensity using the same principle as \\nunderwater weighing, by measuring \\nmass and volume. Clearly, the main \\ndifference is that mass and volume \\nare being determined by air \\ndisplacement rather than water \\ndisplacement. Using a commercial \\ndevice (the Bod Pod is most \\ncommonly referenced), a person sits \\nin a chamber that varies the air \\npressure allowing for body volume \\nto be assessed. Air displacement \\nprovides a viable alternative for \\nthose with a fear of water.  \\n \\nLike many other methods, the \\nexpense, availability, and training of \\npersonnel Air Displacement requires \\nlimit accessibility. Additionally, its \\naccuracy is slightly less than \\nunderwater weighing.  \\n \\n• Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis \\n(BIA) \\nBIA takes a slightly different \\napproach to measuring FFM. The \\npremise behind BIA is that FFM will \\nbe proportional to the electrical \\nconductivity of the body. Fat-tissue \\ncontains little water, making it a \\npoor conductor of electricity; \\nwhereas, lean tissue contains mostly'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='7 \\nFlynn | BODY COMPOSITION \\nwater and electrolytes, making it an \\nexcellent conductor. BIA devices \\nemit a low-level electrical current \\nthrough the body and measure the \\namount of resistance the current \\nencounters. Based on the level of \\nimpedance, a pre-programed \\nequation is used to estimate body \\nfat percentage.  \\nThe most accurate BIA devices use \\nelectrodes on the feet and hands to \\nadminister the point-to-point \\nelectrical current. The margin of \\nerror for these devices falls in the \\nrange of 3–5%. Portable or handheld \\nBIA devices that only measure lower \\nor upper body conductivity have a \\nhigher margin of error (4–8%).  \\n \\nBecause BIA devices primarily \\nmeasure hydration, circumstances \\nthat may influence hydration status \\nat the time of measurement must be \\ntaken into account. Recent exercise, \\nbladder content, hydration habits, \\nand meal timing can cause wide \\nmeasurement variations and \\ninfluence accuracy. However, this \\nmethod is generally inexpensive, \\noften portable, and requires limited \\ntraining to use, making it a very \\npractical option. \\n \\n• Skinfold Analysis \\nSkinfold analysis is a widely used \\nmethod of assessing body \\ncomposition because of its \\nsimplicity, portability, and \\naffordability. It is also fairly accurate \\nwhen administered properly. \\nMargins of error are about 4–7%, \\ndepending on the quality of the \\nskinfold calipers and skill of the \\nadministrator/technician. The \\nassumption of skinfold \\nmeasurement is that the amount of \\nsubcutaneous fat is proportionate to \\noverall body fat. As such, a \\ntechnician pinches the skin at \\nvarious sites and uses calipers to \\nmeasure and record the diameter of \\nthe skin folds. These numbers can \\nthen be plugged into an equation to \\ngenerate an estimate of body fat \\npercentage.  \\n \\nThe proportionality of subcutaneous \\nfat and overall body fat depends on \\nage, gender, ethnicity, and activity \\nrates. As such, technicians should \\nuse the skinfold technique specific \\nto the equation that accounts for \\nthose variables to improve accuracy.  \\n \\n \\nWeighing in on the U.S. \\n \\nDespite the well-known health concerns \\nimplicated in overweight and obesity and \\nthe availability of multiple methods for \\nassessment and tools to improve body \\ncomposition, current trends in the United \\nStates and around the world are moving in \\nthe wrong direction. The unprecedented \\nnumber of obese Americans has led experts \\nto label it an epidemic, much like they \\nwould a disease in a developing country.  \\nAccording to the CDC, the number of \\nAmerican adults (>20 years) that fall into \\nthe overweight classification based on BMI \\nare 70.7%. Of those, 37.9% fall within the \\nobese classification. In 1962, the \\noverweight and obesity rates for adults in \\nthe U.S. were 32% and 13%, respectively. In \\nother words, overweight trends have more \\nthan doubled and obesity rates have almost \\ntripled over the past 50+ years.\\n12'),\n",

However, it is \\ngenerally believed this is an accurate \\nportrayal of weight status. In a study \\nattempting to compare BMI measurements \\nto actual body fat percentage, it was \\ndetermined that the total number of obese \\ncitizens may be underestimated, and its \\ncurrent prevalence may be worse than is \\ncurrently being reported.  \\n \\n \\nWhat Can Be Done? \\n \\nWith the available tools to identify health \\nrisks associated with body fat, anyone \\nconcerned about their health should gather \\nas much data about body composition and \\nbody fat distribution as possible. Compiling \\nmultiple measurements and analyzing them \\nprovides a better idea of a person’s current \\nhealth status and will help determine the \\nnext course of action. For example, BMI \\nalone can be beneficial. But when combined \\nwith waist circumference, a greater \\nunderstanding of risk can be achieved. \\nLikewise, when combining BMI and waist \\ncircumference with body fat percentage, an \\nideal conclusion of health status can be \\nmade.   \\n \\nIn the lab accompanying this chapter, you \\nwill be guided through the process of \\nassessing your BMI, waist circumference, \\nwaist-to-hip ratio, and body fat percentage. \\n \\nThe next course of action is to set goals and \\nformulate a plan to get to a healthy range \\nof weight and body fat percentage. Where \\nweight loss is needed, the plan should \\ninclude a balance of calorie restriction and \\nphysical activity/exercise. This might also \\ninclude tracking your current eating and \\nactivity habits. More specific information on \\nweight management strategies will be \\ndiscussed in a later chapter.  \\n \\n \\nLow Body Composition \\n \\nBecause more people experience excess \\nbody fat, the focus up to this point has been \\non health concerns related to overweight \\nand obesity. However, fat is an essential \\ncomponent to a healthy body, and in rare \\ncases, individuals have insufficient fat \\nreserves, which can also be a health \\nconcern. The range of essential body fat for \\nmales is 3-5% and 8-12% for females. \\nAttempting to, or intentionally staying in \\nthose ranges, through excessive exercise or \\ncalorie restriction is not recommended. \\nUnfortunately, low body fat is often \\nassociated with individuals struggling with \\neating disorders, the majority of whom are \\nfemales.  \\n \\nThe main concern of low body fat relates to \\nthe number and quality of calories being \\nconsumed. Foods not only provide energy \\nbut also provide the necessary nutrients to \\nfacilitate vital body functions. For example, \\nlow amounts of iron from a poor diet can \\nresult in anemia. Potassium deficiencies can'),\n",

If adequate \\ncalcium is not being obtained from foods, \\nbone deficiencies will result. Clearly, having \\nlow body fat, depending on the cause, can \\nbe equally as detrimental to health as \\nhaving too much.  \\n \\nThe health concerns most often linked to \\nlow body fat are: \\n• Reproductive disorders \\no Infrequent or missing menstrual \\ncycles \\n• Respiratory disorders \\n• Immune System disorders \\n• Circulatory disorders \\n• Premature death \\n \\nIn some cases, despite attempts to gain \\nweight, individuals are unable to gain the \\npounds needed to maintain a healthy \\nweight.

However, \\nwhen they use the term stress, they rarely \\nknow its true meaning. The word carries \\nmany negative connotations and is \\nassociated with an unpleasant or traumatic \\nevent. As such, people mistakenly believe \\nthat stress is simply the nervousness and \\ntension experienced prior to, during, or \\nafter a negative event. In fact, the effects of \\nstress are physiological, emotional, and \\npsychological.  \\n \\n \\nAdditionally, not all levels of stress are \\ndetrimental. The stress athletes experience \\nright before a big game or college students \\nfeel right before an exam can enhance \\nfocus and increase their ability to \\nconcentrate. Stress is either good or bad \\ndepending on how long it persists and how \\nit is perceived by the individual.  \\n \\nThis chapter will provide a deeper \\nunderstanding of what stress is and provide \\neffective strategies for managing stress.  \\n \\n \\nWhat Is Stress and How \\nDoes It Affect W ellness?  \\n \\nStress is defined as the body’s physical, \\nmental, and emotional response to a \\nparticular stimulus, called a stressor. This \\nadaption/coping-response helps the body \\nprepare for challenging situations. It is the \\nlevel of a person’s response to a stressor \\nthat determines whether the experience is \\npositive or negative. As a hardworking \\ncollege student, you may feel as if you know \\nthe meaning of stress all too well. You may \\ndream of a future where the demands on \\nyour time are diminished, so you can \\nescape the high levels of stress you are \\nfeeling now. Unfortunately, regardless of \\nAnxiety.

The good news is, not all \\nstress is bad! Small levels of stress can \\nenhance cognitive brain function. Stress \\nmay provide the motivation and \\nconcentration you need to write an essay, \\npractice a speech, or prepare for a job \\ninterview. For most people, these types of \\nstressors are manageable and not harmful. \\nStressors that have the potential for harm \\ninclude the sudden loss of a loved one, the \\nunexpected ending of a romantic \\nrelationship, or the unfair demands of an \\nunreasonable boss.  \\n \\n \\nDefining Stress \\n \\nStress, then, is more than simply the \\ntension and apprehension generated by \\nproblems, obstacles, or traumatic events. \\nStress is the body’s automatic response \\n(physical, mental, and emotional\\n) to any \\nstressor. It is a natural and unavoidable part \\nof life, and it can be empowering and \\nmotivating, or harmful and potentially \\ndangerous.  \\n \\nFor more information on stress click on the \\nlinks below: \\n \\nWhat is Stress?\\n \\n \\nUnderstanding and Dealing with Stress\\n \\n \\nBelow is a video on stress. \\n \\nWhat is stress and what causes it?\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEffects of Stress on Wellness \\n \\nAs stated previously, not all stress is bad. In \\nfact, the stress associated with riding a \\nroller coaster, watching a scary movie, or \\nscaling a cliff can enhance these \\nexperiences. Regardless of whether the \\nstress experienced is negative or positive, \\nthe effects on the body are identical.  \\nWhen a person senses that a situation \\ndemands action, the body responds by \\nreleasing chemicals into the blood. The \\nhypothalamus signals the adrenal glands to \\nrelease a surge of hormones that include \\nadrenaline and cortisol. The physiological \\neffects of those chemicals—enhanced \\nfocus, quicker reaction time, and increased \\nheart rate, energy, and strength—are quite \\nbeneficial when faced with a potentially \\ndangerous situation that is temporary.  \\n \\nUnfortunately, most of the stressors people \\nface—work, school, finances, \\nrelationships—are a part of everyday life, \\nand thus, inescapable. Experiencing \\nongoing, unavoidable stress can result in \\nsome very unpleasant and harmful effects, \\nboth mental and physical. Chronic stress \\ncan cause upset stomach, headaches, sleep \\nproblems, and heart disease. It can also \\ncause depression, anxiety, and even \\nmemory loss.  \\n \\nTo watch a video that describes the effects \\nof stress in detail, click on the link below: \\n \\nHow Stress Affects Your Body and Mind'),\n",

That \\ndocument is linked here: \\nTips: Coping \\nStrategies. For your convenience, it is also \\nreprinted below with the ADAA’s \\npermission.  \\n \\nWhen you are feeling anxious or stressed, \\nthese strategies will help you cope: \\n \\n• Take a time-out. Practice yoga, \\nlisten to music, meditate, get a \\nmassage, or learn relaxation \\ntechniques. Stepping back from the \\nproblem helps clear your head. \\n• Eat well-balanced meals. Do not \\nskip any meals. Do keep healthful, \\nenergy-boosting snacks on hand. \\n• Limit alcohol and caffeine, which \\ncan aggravate anxiety and trigger \\npanic attacks. \\n• Get enough sleep. When stressed, \\nyour body needs additional sleep \\nand rest. \\n• Exercise daily to help you feel good \\nand maintain your health. Check out \\nthe fitness tips below. \\n• Take deep breaths. Inhale and \\nexhale slowly. \\n• Count to 10 slowly. Repeat, and \\ncount to 20 if necessary. \\n• Do your best. Instead of aiming for \\nperfection, which isn't possible, be \\nproud of however close you get. \\n• Accept that you cannot control \\neverything. Put your stress in \\nperspective: Is it really as bad as you \\nthink? \\n• Welcome humor. A good laugh goes \\na long way. \\n• Maintain a positive attitude. Make \\nan effort to replace negative \\nthoughts with positive ones. \\n• Get involved. Volunteer or find \\nanother way to be active in your \\ncommunity, which creates a support \\nnetwork and gives you a break from \\neveryday stress. \\n• Learn what triggers your anxiety. Is \\nit work, family, school, or something \\nelse you can identify? Write in a \\njournal when you’re feeling stressed \\nor anxious and look for a pattern. \\n• Talk to someone.

Moser \\nObjectives: \\n• Define cancer and how cancer arises \\n• Describe different types of cancer   \\n• Identify cancer risks and methods for cancer prevention \\n• Assess personal cancer risk \\n \\n \\nWhat Is Cancer? \\n \\nCancer is the name given to a collection of \\nrelated diseases in which the body’s cells \\nbegin to divide without stopping and spread \\ninto surrounding tissues. \\n \\nCancer can start almost anywhere in the \\nhuman body, which is made up of trillions \\nof cells. Normally, human cells grow and \\ndivide to form new cells as the body needs \\nthem. When cells grow old or become \\ndamaged, they die, and new cells take their \\nplace. \\n \\nWhen cancer develops, however, this \\norderly process breaks down. As cells \\nbecome more and more abnormal, old or \\ndamaged cells survive when they should \\ndie, and new cells form when they are not \\nneeded. These extra cells can divide \\nwithout stopping and may form growths \\ncalled tumors. \\n \\nMany cancers form solid tumors, which are \\nmasses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such \\nas leukemias, generally do not form solid \\ntumors. \\n \\nCancerous tumors are malignant, which \\nmeans they can spread into, or invade, \\nnearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors \\ngrow, some cancer cells can break off and \\ntravel to distant places in the body through \\nthe blood or the lymph system and form \\nnew tumors far from the original tumor. \\n \\nUnlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do \\nnot invade nearby tissues. However, some \\nbenign tumors can be quite large. When \\nremoved, they usually do not grow back, \\nwhereas malignant tumors sometimes do. \\nUnlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the \\nbody, benign tumors in the brain can be life \\nthreatening. \\n \\n \\nHow Cancer Arises \\n \\nCancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is \\ncaused by changes to genes that control the \\nway our cells function, especially how they \\ngrow and divide. \\n \\nGenetic changes that cause cancer can be \\ninherited. They can also be the result of \\nerrors that occur as cells divide or \\nenvironmental exposures that cause \\ndamage to DNA, the molecules inside cells \\nthat carry genetic information and pass it \\non from one generation to the next. Cancer-\\ncausing environmental exposures include'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Cancer Development  2 \\n \\nsubstances, such as the chemicals in \\ntobacco smoke; and radiation, such as \\nultraviolet rays from the sun.  \\n \\nEach person’s cancer has a unique \\ncombination of genetic changes. As the \\ncancer continues to grow, additional \\nchanges will occur. Even within the same \\ntumor, different cells may have different \\ngenetic changes. \\n \\nIn general, cancer cells have more genetic \\nchanges, such as mutations in DNA, than \\nnormal cells. Some of these changes may be \\nthe result of the cancer, rather than its \\ncause. \\n \\n \\nCancer Statistics \\n \\nCancer severely impacts Americans and \\nsocieties throughout the world. Cancer \\nstatistics describe what happens in large \\ngroups of people and provide a picture in \\ntime of the burden of cancer on society. \\nStatistics indicate how many people are \\ndiagnosed with and die from cancer each \\nyear, the number of people who are \\ncurrently living after a cancer diagnosis, and \\nthe average age at diagnosis. They also \\nreveal differences among groups defined by \\nage, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic \\nlocation, and other categories. \\n \\nAlthough statistical trends are usually not \\ndirectly applicable to individual patients, \\nthey are essential for governments, \\npolicymakers, health professionals, and \\nresearchers to understand the impact of \\ncancer on the population and to develop \\nstrategies to address the challenges that \\ncancer poses to society. Statistical trends \\nare also important for measuring the \\nsuccess of efforts to control and manage \\ncancer. \\n \\n \\nStatistics at a Glance: The Burden of \\nCancer in the United States \\n \\n• In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 \\nnew cases of cancer will be \\ndiagnosed in the United States, and \\n595,690 people will die from the \\ndisease. \\n \\n• The most common cancers in 2016 \\nare projected to be breast cancer, \\nlung and bronchus cancer, prostate \\ncancer, colon and rectum cancer, \\nbladder cancer, melanoma of the \\nskin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, \\nthyroid cancer, kidney and renal \\npelvis cancer, leukemia, endometrial \\ncancer, and pancreatic cancer. \\n \\n• The number of new cases of cancer \\n(cancer incidence) is 454.8 per \\n100,000 men and women per year \\n(based on 2008–2012 cases). \\n \\n• The number of cancer deaths \\n(cancer mortality) is 171.2 per \\n100,000 men and women per year \\n(based on 2008–2012 deaths). \\n \\n• Cancer mortality is higher among \\nmen than women (207.9 per \\n100,000 men and 145.4 per 100,000 \\nwomen). It is highest in African \\nAmerican men (261.5 per 100,000) \\nand lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander \\nwomen (91.2 per 100,000) per year \\n(based on 2008–2012 deaths).'),\n",

Cancers may also be described by \\nthe type of cell that formed them, such as \\nan epithelial cell or a squamous cell.   \\n \\nSome types of cancer are: \\n \\nBreast Cancer \\n \\nThe breast is made up of glands called \\nlobules that can make milk and thin tubes \\ncalled ducts that carry the milk from the \\nlobules to the nipple. Breast tissue also \\ncontains fat and connective tissue, lymph \\nnodes, and blood vessels. \\n \\nThe most common type of breast cancer is \\nductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells \\nof the ducts. Breast cancer can also begin in \\nthe cells of the lobules and in other tissues \\nin the breast. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a \\ncondition in which abnormal cells are found \\nin the lining of the ducts but have not \\nspread outside the duct. Breast cancer that \\nhas spread from where it began in the ducts \\nor lobules to surrounding tissue is called \\ninvasive breast cancer. In inflammatory \\nbreast cancer, the breast looks red and \\nswollen and feels warm because the cancer \\ncells block the lymph vessels in the skin. \\n \\nIn the United States, breast cancer is the \\nsecond most common cancer in women \\nafter skin cancer. It can occur in both men \\nand women, but it is rare in men.

The \\ncervix leads from the uterus to the vagina, \\nalso known as the birth canal. \\n \\nThe main types of cervical cancer are \\nsquamous cell carcinoma and \\nadenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma \\nbegins in the thin, flat cells that line the \\ncervix. Adenocarcinoma begins in cervical \\ncells that make mucus and other fluids. \\n \\nLong-lasting infections with certain types of \\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV) cause almost \\nall cases of cervical cancer. Vaccines that \\nprotect against infection with these types of \\nHPV can greatly reduce the risk of cervical \\ncancer.  \\n \\n \\nScreening tests: \\n• Pap test and human papillomavirus \\n(HPV) testing \\nHaving a Pap test to check for \\nabnormal cells in the cervix, or a test \\nto check for HPV, can find cells that \\nmay become cervical cancer. These \\ncells can be treated before cancer \\nforms.  Testing is generally \\nrecommended to begin at age 21 \\nand to end at age 65, as long as \\nrecent results have been normal. \\n \\nCervical cancer can usually be cured \\nif it is found and treated in the early \\nstages. \\n \\n \\nColorectal Cancer \\n \\nColorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the \\ncolon or rectum. The colon and the rectum \\nare parts of the large intestine, which is the \\nlower part of the body’s digestive system. \\nDuring digestion, food moves through the \\nstomach and small intestine into the colon. \\nThe colon absorbs water and nutrients from \\nthe food and stores waste matter called \\nstool. Stool moves from the colon into the \\nrectum before it leaves the body. \\n \\nMost colorectal cancers are \\nadenocarcinomas, cancers that begin in \\ncells that make and release mucus and \\nother fluids. Colorectal cancer often begins \\nas an abnormal colon growth called a polyp, \\nwhich may form on the inner wall of the \\ncolon or rectum. Some polyps may develop \\ninto cancer over time. Finding and removing \\npolyps can prevent colorectal cancer. \\n \\nColorectal cancer is the third most common \\ntype of cancer in men and women in the \\nUnited States.'),\n",

Colonoscopy and \\nsigmoidoscopy also help prevent \\ncolorectal cancer because they can \\ndetect polyps that can be removed \\nbefore they develop into cancer. \\nExpert groups generally recommend \\nthat people who are at average risk \\nfor colorectal cancer have screening \\nbeginning at age 50 through age 75. \\n \\n \\nLung Cancer \\n \\nMost lung cancer diagnoses are either non-\\nsmall cell lung cancer or small cell lung \\ncancer, depending on the way the cells look \\nunder a microscope. Non-small cell lung \\ncancer is much more common than small \\ncell lung cancer. \\n \\nMost cases of lung cancer are caused by \\nsmoking. Lung cancer is the leading cause of \\ndeath from cancer in the United States. \\n \\nFor most patients with lung cancer, current \\ntreatments do not cure the cancer. \\n \\nScreening test: \\n• Low-dose helical computed \\ntomography \\nThis test, which is used to screen for \\nlung cancer, has been shown to \\nreduce lung cancer deaths among \\nheavy smokers aged from 55 to 74. \\n \\n \\nProstate Cancer \\n \\nThe prostate gland makes fluid that forms \\npart of semen. The prostate lies just below \\nthe bladder in front of the rectum. It \\nsurrounds the urethra, the tube that carries \\nurine and semen through the penis and out \\nof the body. \\n \\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer \\nin men in the United States, after skin \\ncancer, and the second leading cause of \\ndeath. Prostate cancer occurs more often in \\nAfrican-American men than in white men. \\nAfrican-American men with prostate cancer \\nare more likely to die from the disease than \\nwhite men with prostate cancer. \\n \\nAlmost all prostate cancers are \\nadenocarcinomas, cancers that begin in \\ncells that make and release mucus and \\nother fluids. Prostate cancer often has no \\nearly symptoms. Advanced prostate cancer \\ncan cause men to urinate more often or \\nhave a weaker flow of urine, but these \\nsymptoms can also be caused by benign \\nprostate conditions. \\n \\nProstate cancer usually grows very slowly. \\nMost men with prostate cancer are older \\nthan 65 years and do not die from the \\ndisease. Finding and treating prostate \\ncancer before symptoms occur may not \\nimprove a patient’s health or help him live \\nlonger.

However, expert groups \\nno longer recommend routine PSA \\ntesting for most men because \\nstudies have shown that it has little \\nor no effect on prostate cancer \\ndeaths and leads to overdiagnosis \\nand overtreatment. \\n \\n \\nSkin Cancer \\n \\nSkin cancer is the most common type of \\ncancer. It usually forms in skin that has \\nbeen exposed to sunlight but can occur \\nanywhere on the body. \\n \\nSkin consists of several layers. Skin cancer \\nbegins in the epidermis, or outer layer, \\nwhich is made up of squamous cells, basal \\ncells, and melanocytes. \\n \\nThere are several different types of skin \\ncancer. Squamous cell and basal cell skin \\ncancers are sometimes called \\nnonmelanoma skin cancers.  \\n \\nNonmelanoma skin cancer usually responds \\nto treatment and rarely spreads to other \\nparts of the body.  \\n \\nMelanoma is more aggressive than most \\nother types of skin cancer. Unless \\nmelanoma is diagnosed early, it is likely to \\ninvade nearby tissues and spread to other \\nparts of the body. The number of cases of \\nmelanoma increases each year. Only 2 \\npercent of all skin cancers are melanoma, \\nbut it causes the most deaths from skin \\ncancer. \\n \\n \\n \\nScreening test: \\n• Skin exams \\nDoctors often recommend that \\npeople who are at risk for skin \\ncancer examine their skin regularly \\nor have a health care provider do so. \\nSuch exams have not been shown to \\ndecrease the risk of dying from skin \\ncancer, and they may lead to \\novertreatment. However, people \\nshould be aware of changes in their \\nskin, such as a new mole or a change \\nto an existing mole, and report these \\nto their doctor promptly. \\n \\n \\nTesticular Cancer \\n \\nThe testicles are two glands inside the \\nscrotum, a sac of loose skin below the \\npenis. The testicles make sperm and the \\nhormone testosterone. \\n \\nTesticular cancer is the most common \\ncancer in men aged from 15 to 34 years. \\nThe two main types of testicular tumors are \\nseminoma and nonseminoma. \\nNonseminomas tend to grow and spread \\nmore quickly than seminomas. \\n \\nThe most common sign of testicular cancer \\nis a lump or swelling in the testicle. Most \\ntesticular cancers can be cured, even if they \\nare diagnosed at an advanced stage. \\n \\nTreatment for testicular cancer can cause \\ninfertility by decreasing the amount of \\nsperm made by the body.

Most \\nblood cells form in the bone marrow. In \\nleukemia, immature blood cells become \\ncancer. These cells do not work the way \\nthey should and crowd out the healthy \\nblood cells in the bone marrow. \\n \\nDifferent types of leukemia depend on the \\ntype of blood cell that becomes cancer. For \\nexample, lymphoblastic leukemia is a \\ncancer of the lymphoblasts, white blood \\ncells that fight infection. White blood cells \\nare the most common type of blood cell to \\nbecome cancer. But red blood cells, cells \\nthat carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest \\nof the body, and platelets, cells that clot the \\nblood, may also become cancerous. \\n \\nLeukemia occurs most often in adults older \\nthan 55 years, but it is also the most \\ncommon cancer in children younger than 15 \\nyears. \\n \\nLeukemia can be either acute or chronic. \\nAcute leukemia is a fast-growing cancer \\nthat usually gets worse quickly. Chronic \\nleukemia is a slower-growing cancer that \\ngets worse slowly over time. The treatment \\nand prognosis for leukemia depend on the \\ntype of blood cell affected and whether the \\nleukemia is acute or chronic. \\n \\n \\nLymphoma \\n \\nLymphoma is cancer that begins in cells of \\nthe lymph system. The lymph system is part \\nof the immune system, which helps the \\nbody fight infection and disease. Because \\nlymph tissue is found all through the body, \\nlymphoma can begin almost anywhere. \\n \\nThe two main types of lymphoma are \\nHodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin \\nlymphoma (NHL). These can occur in both \\nchildren and adults. The treatment and \\nprobability of a cure depend on the stage \\nand the type of lymphoma. \\n \\n \\nRisk Factors for Cancer \\n \\nIt is usually impossible to know why one \\nperson develops cancer and another does \\nnot. But research has shown that certain \\nrisk factors may increase a person’s chances \\nof developing cancer. There are also \\nfactors—called protective risk factors, or \\njust protective factors—that are linked to a \\nlower risk of cancer.  \\n \\nCancer risk factors include exposure to \\nchemicals or other substances, as well as \\ncertain behaviors. They also include \\ncircumstances that people cannot control, \\nlike age and family history. A family history \\nof certain cancers can be a sign of a possible \\ninherited cancer syndrome.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ALG Concepts of Fitness and Wellness.pdf'}, page_content='Cancer Development  8 \\n \\nMost cancer risks, as well as protective \\nfactors, are initially identified in \\nepidemiology studies. In these studies, \\nscientists look at large groups of people and \\ncompare those who develop cancer with \\nthose who do not. These studies may show \\nthat those who develop cancer are more or \\nless likely to behave in certain ways, or to \\nbe exposed to certain substances, than \\nthose who do not develop cancer. \\n \\nOn their own, such studies cannot prove \\nthat a behavior or substance causes cancer. \\nFor example, the finding could be a result of \\nchance, or the true risk factor could be \\nsomething other than the suspected risk \\nfactor. But findings of this type sometimes \\nget attention in the media, and this can lead \\nto false beliefs about how cancer starts and \\nspreads.  \\n \\nWhen many studies all point to a similar \\nassociation between a potential risk factor \\nand an increased risk of cancer, and when a \\npossible mechanism exists that could \\nexplain how the risk factor could actually \\ncause cancer, scientists can be more \\nconfident about the relationship between \\nthe two. \\n \\nAlthough some risk factors can be avoided, \\nothers—such as growing older—cannot. \\nLimiting exposure to avoidable risk factors \\nmay lower a person’s risk of developing \\ncertain cancers. \\nSome of the most studied risk factors for \\ncancer are listed below. \\nAge \\n \\nAdvancing age is the most important risk \\nfactor for cancer overall, and for many \\nspecific types of cancer. According to the \\nmost recent statistical data from the \\nNational Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, \\nEpidemiology, and End Results program, the \\nmedian age of a cancer diagnosis is 66 \\nyears. This means that half of cancer cases \\noccur in people below this age and half in \\npeople above this age. One-quarter of new \\ncancer cases are diagnosed in people aged \\nfrom 65 to 74.  \\n \\nBut the disease can occur at any age. For \\nexample, bone cancer is most frequently \\ndiagnosed among people under age 20, \\nwith more than one-fourth of cases \\noccurring in this age group. And 10 percent \\nof leukemias are diagnosed in children and \\nadolescents under 20 years of age, whereas \\nonly 1 percent of cancer overall is \\ndiagnosed in that age group. \\n \\n \\nAlcohol \\n \\nDrinking alcohol can increase a person’s risk \\nof cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, \\nlarynx (voice box), liver, and breast. The \\nmore a person consumes alcohol, the \\nhigher his or her risk. The risk of cancer is \\nmuch higher for those who drink alcohol \\nand also use tobacco. \\n \\nDoctors advise people who drink to do so in \\nmoderate amounts. The federal \\ngovernment’s Dietary Guidelines for \\nAmericans defines moderate alcohol \\ndrinking as up to one drink per day for \\nwomen and up to two drinks per day for \\nmen. \\n \\nIt has been suggested that certain \\nsubstances in red wine, such as resveratrol, \\nhave anticancer properties. However, no'),\n",

But others are the \\nresult of environmental exposures that \\ndamage DNA. These exposures may include \\nsubstances known as carcinogens, any \\nsubstance that causes cancer, such as the \\nchemicals in tobacco smoke; and radiation, \\nsuch as ultraviolet rays from the sun. \\nPeople can avoid some cancer-causing \\nexposures, such as tobacco smoke and the \\nsun’s rays. But others are harder to avoid, \\nespecially if they are found in the air, water, \\nand food, or the materials people use to do \\ntheir jobs. Scientists are studying which \\nexposures may cause or contribute to the \\ndevelopment of cancer. Understanding \\nwhich exposures are harmful, and where \\nthey are found, may help people avoid \\nthem. \\n \\nSimply because a substance has been \\ndesignated as a carcinogen, however, that \\ndoes not mean that the substance will \\nnecessarily cause cancer. Many factors \\ninfluence whether a person exposed to a \\ncarcinogen will develop cancer, including \\nthe amount and duration of the exposure \\nand the individual’s genetic background. \\n \\n \\nDiet \\n \\nMany studies have looked at the possibility \\nthat specific dietary components or \\nnutrients are associated with increases or \\ndecreases in cancer risk. Studies of cancer \\ncells in the laboratory and of animal models \\nhave sometimes provided evidence that \\nisolated compounds may be carcinogenic, \\nor have anticancer activity. \\n \\nBut with few exceptions, studies of human \\npopulations have not yet shown definitively \\nthat any dietary component causes or \\nprotects against cancer. Sometimes the \\nresults of epidemiologic studies, which \\ncompare the diets of people with and \\nwithout cancer have indicated that people \\nwith and without cancer differ in their \\nintake of a particular dietary component. \\n \\nHowever, these results show only that the \\ndietary component is associated with a \\nchange in cancer risk, not that the dietary \\ncomponent is responsible for, or causes, the \\nchange in risk. For example, participants \\nwith and without cancer could differ in \\nother ways besides their diet, and it is \\npossible that some other difference \\naccounts for the variance in cancer risk. \\n \\n \\nHormones \\n \\nEstrogens, a group of female sex hormones, \\nare known human carcinogens.

Being exposed for a long \\ntime and/or to high levels of these \\nhormones has been linked to an increased \\nrisk of breast cancer. Increases in exposure \\ncan be caused by starting menstruation \\nearly, going through menopause late, being \\nolder at first pregnancy, and never having \\ngiven birth. Conversely, having given birth is \\na protective factor for breast cancer. \\n \\n \\nObesity \\n \\nPeople who are obese may have an \\nincreased risk of several types of cancer, \\nincluding cancers of the breast (in women \\nwho have been through menopause), colon, \\nrectum, esophagus, kidney, pancreas, \\ngallbladder, and the lining of the uterus, \\ncalled the endometrium. \\n \\nConversely, eating a healthy diet, being \\nphysically active, and maintaining a healthy \\nweight may reduce the risk of some \\ncancers. These healthy behaviors also \\nlessen the risk of other illnesses, such as \\nheart disease, type II diabetes, and high \\nblood pressure. \\n \\n \\nSunlight \\n \\nThe sun, sunlamps, and tanning booths all \\ngive off ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Exposure \\nto UV radiation causes early aging of the \\nskin and skin damage that can lead to skin \\ncancer. \\n \\nPeople of all ages should limit the amount \\nof time they spend in the sun, especially \\nbetween mid-morning and late afternoon, \\nand avoid other sources of UV radiation, \\nsuch as tanning beds. It is important to keep \\nin mind that UV radiation is reflected by \\nsand, water, snow, and ice and can go \\nthrough windshields and windows. \\n \\nThe best way to lessen UV damage when \\nspending time in the sun is to wear long \\nsleeves, long pants, a hat with a wide brim, \\nand sunglasses with lenses that absorb UV \\nradiation. Sunscreen with a sun protection \\nfactor (SPF) of at least 15 may help prevent \\nskin cancer but does not work as well as \\nstaying out of the sun and wearing \\nprotective clothing. \\n \\n \\nTobacco \\n \\nTobacco use is a leading cause of cancer \\nand of death from cancer. People who use \\ntobacco products, or are regularly exposed \\nto environmental tobacco smoke (called \\nsecondhand smoke), have an increased risk \\nof cancer because tobacco products and \\nsecondhand smoke have many chemicals \\nthat damage DNA. \\n \\nTobacco use causes many types of cancer, \\nincluding cancer of the lung, larynx, mouth, \\nesophagus, throat, bladder, kidney, liver, \\nstomach, pancreas, colon and rectum, and'),\n",

It is considered a \\nbrain disease because drugs change the \\nbrain by changing its structure and how it \\nworks. These brain changes can be long-\\nlasting and can lead to the harmful \\nbehaviors seen in people who abuse drugs. \\n \\nAddiction is a lot like other diseases, such as \\nheart disease. Both disrupt the normal, \\nhealthy functioning of the underlying organ, \\nhave serious harmful consequences, and \\nare preventable and treatable, but if left \\nuntreated, can last a lifetime. \\n \\n \\nWhy do people use drugs? \\n \\nIn general, people begin taking drugs for a \\nvariety of reasons: \\n \\n• To feel good  \\nMost abused drugs produce intense \\nfeelings of pleasure. This initial \\nsensation of euphoria is followed by \\nother effects, which differ \\ndepending on the type of drug used. \\nFor example, with stimulants such as \\ncocaine, the “high” is followed by \\nfeelings of power, self-confidence, \\nand increased energy. In contrast, \\nthe euphoria caused by opiates, \\nsuch as heroin, is followed by \\nfeelings of relaxation and \\nsatisfaction. \\n \\n• To feel better \\nSome people who suffer from social \\nanxiety, stress-related disorders, \\nand depression begin abusing drugs \\nin an attempt to lessen feelings of \\ndistress. Stress can play a major role \\nin initial drug use, continuing drug \\nabuse, or relapse in patients \\nrecovering from addiction. \\n \\n• To do better  \\nSome people feel pressure to \\nchemically enhance or improve their \\ncognitive or athletic performance, \\nwhich can play a role in initial \\nexperimentation and continued'),\n",

Teens are more likely than \\nadults to engage in risky or daring \\nbehaviors to impress their friends \\nand express their independence \\nfrom parental and social rules.  \\n \\n \\nIf taking drugs makes people feel \\ngood or better, what\\'s the problem? \\n \\nWhen they first use a drug, people may \\nperceive what seem to be positive effects. \\nThey may also believe that they can control \\ntheir use. However, drugs can quickly take \\nover a person’s life. Over time, if drug use \\ncontinues, other pleasurable activities \\nbecome less pleasurable and taking the \\ndrug becomes necessary for the user just to \\nfeel normal. They may then compulsively \\nseek and take drugs even though doing so \\ncauses tremendous problems for \\nthemselves and their loved ones. Some \\npeople may start to feel the need to take \\nhigher or more frequent doses, even in the \\nearly stages of their drug use. These are the \\ntelltale signs of an addiction. \\n \\nEven relatively moderate drug use poses \\ndangers. Consider how a social drinker can \\nbecome intoxicated, get behind the wheel \\nof a car, and quickly turn a pleasurable \\nactivity into a tragedy that affects many \\nlives. \\n \\n \\n \\nIs continued drug abuse a voluntary \\nbehavior? \\n \\nThe initial decision to take drugs is typically \\nvoluntary. However, with continued use, a \\nperson’s ability to exert self-control can \\nbecome seriously impaired; this impairment \\nin self-control is the hallmark of addiction. \\nBrain imaging studies of people with \\naddiction show physical changes in areas of \\nthe brain that are critical to judgment, \\ndecision making, learning and memory, and \\nbehavior control.\\n  Scientists believe that \\nthese changes alter the way the brain works \\nand may help explain the compulsive and \\ndestructive behaviors of addiction. \\n \\n \\nWhy do some people become \\naddicted to drugs while others do \\nnot? \\n \\nAs with any other disease, vulnerability to \\naddiction differs from person to person, \\nand no single factor determines whether a \\nperson will become addicted to drugs.

Here are descriptions of some of \\nthe most common and well known: \\n \\nChlamydia \\n \\nChlamydia\\n1 (pronounced kla-MID-ee-uh) is a \\ncommon STD/STI caused by the bacterium \\nChlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydia can be \\ntransmitted during vaginal, oral, or anal \\nsexual contact with an infected partner. \\nWhile many individuals will not experience \\nsymptoms, chlamydia can cause fever, \\nabdominal pain, and unusual discharge of \\nthe penis or vagina. \\n \\nIn women, whether or not they are having \\nsymptoms and know about their infection, \\nchlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory \\ndisease (PID). In PID, the untreated STD/STI \\nprogresses and involves other parts of the \\nwoman's reproductive system, including the \\nuterus and fallopian tubes. This progression \\ncan lead to permanent damage to the \\nwoman's reproductive organs. This damage \\nmay lead to ectopic pregnancy (in which the \\nfetus develops in abnormal places outside \\nof the womb, a condition that can be life-\\nthreatening) and infertility. \\n \\nAdditionally, if the woman is pregnant, her \\ndeveloping fetus is at risk, because \\nchlamydia can be passed on during her \\npregnancy or delivery and could lead to eye \\ninfections or pneumonia in the infant. If \\nchlamydia is detected early, it can be \\ntreated easily with an antibiotic taken by \\nmouth. \\n \\nGonorrhea \\n \\nGonorrhea\\n2 (pronounced gon-uh-REE-uh) is \\ncaused by the bacterium Neisseria \\ngonorrhoeae, which can grow rapidly and \\nmultiply easily in the warm, moist areas of \\nthe reproductive tract. The most common \\nsymptoms of gonorrheal infection are a \\ndischarge from the vagina or penis and \\npainful or difficult urination. \\n \\nAs with chlamydial infection, the most \\ncommon and serious complications of \\ngonorrhea occur in women and include\"),\n",

Gonorrhea also can \\ninfect the mouth, throat, eyes, and rectum \\nand can spread to the blood and joints, \\nwhere it can become a life-threatening \\nillness. \\n \\nIn addition, people with gonorrhea can \\nmore easily contract HIV, the virus that \\ncauses AIDS. HIV-infected people with \\ngonorrhea are also more likely to transmit \\nthe virus to someone else.\\n3 \\n \\n \\nGenital Herpes \\n \\nGenital herpes\\n4 is a contagious infection \\ncaused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). \\nThere are two different strains, or types, of \\nHSV: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) \\nand type 2 (HSV-2). Both can cause genital \\nherpes, although most cases of genital \\nherpes are caused by HSV-2.\\n5 When \\nsymptomatic, HSV-1 usually appears as \\nfever blisters or cold sores on the lips, but it \\ncan also infect the genital region through \\noral-genital or genital-genital contact. \\nSymptomatic HSV-2 typically causes painful, \\nwatery skin blisters on or around the \\ngenitals or anus. However, substantial \\nnumbers of people who carry these viruses \\nhave no or only minimal signs or symptoms. \\nNeither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 can be cured, and \\neven during times when an infected person \\nhas no symptoms, the virus can be found in \\nthe body's nerve cells. Periodically, some \\npeople will experience outbreaks in which \\nnew blisters form on the skin in the genital \\narea; at those times, the virus is more likely \\nto be passed on to other people. \\nPregnant women, especially those who \\nacquire genital herpes for the first time \\nduring pregnancy, may pass the infection to \\ntheir newborns, causing life-threatening \\nneonatal HSV, an infection affecting the \\ninfant's skin, brain, and other organs.\\n6 \\n \\n \\nHIV/AIDS \\n \\nHIV, or the human immunodeficiency virus,\\n7 \\nis the virus that causes AIDS (acquired \\nimmunodeficiency syndrome). HIV destroys \\nthe body's immune system by killing the \\nblood cells that fight infection. Once HIV \\ndestroys a substantial proportion of these \\ncells, the body's ability to fight off and \\nrecover from infections is compromised. \\nThis advanced stage of HIV infection is \\nknown as AIDS. \\n \\nPeople whose HIV has progressed to AIDS \\nare very susceptible to opportunistic \\ninfections that do not normally make \\npeople sick and to certain forms of cancer. \\nAIDS can be prevented by early initiation of \\nantiretroviral therapy in those with HIV \\ninfection. Transmission of the virus \\nprimarily occurs during unprotected sexual \\nactivity and by sharing needles used to \\ninject intravenous drugs, although the virus \\nalso can spread from mother to infant \\nduring pregnancy, delivery, and \\nbreastfeeding. \\n \\nIn 2013, NIH-supported researchers \\nreported that a 2-year-old child who was \\nborn with HIV and was treated starting in \\nthe first few days of life has had her HIV \\ninfection go into remission.

Those \\npeople at highest risk for syphilis include \\nmen having sex with both men and women \\nand people residing in the south.\\n10 The first \\nsign of syphilis is a chancre, a painless \\ngenital sore that most often appears on the \\npenis or in and around the vagina. Beyond \\nbeing the first sign of a syphilis infection, \\nchancres make a person two to five times \\nmore likely to contract an HIV infection. If \\nthe person is already infected with HIV, \\nchancres also increase the likelihood that \\nthe virus will be passed on to a sexual \\npartner.\\n3 These sores typically resolve on \\ntheir own, even without treatment. \\nHowever, the body does not clear the \\ninfection on its own, and, over time, syphilis \\nmay involve other organs, including the \\nskin, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and \\njoints in secondary syphilis. If the illness is \\nstill not treated, tertiary syphilis can \\ndevelop over a period of years and involve \\nthe nerves, eyes, and brain and can \\npotentially cause death. \\n \\nExpectant mothers harboring the bacterium \\nare at an increased risk of miscarriage and \\nstillbirth, and they can pass the infection on \\nto their fetuses during pregnancy and \\ndelivery.

While it is \\nhealthy and normal for a vagina to have \\nbacteria, just like the skin, mouth, or \\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract, sometimes \\nchanges in the balance of different types of \\nbacteria can cause problems. \\n \\nBacterial vaginosis occurs when problematic \\nbacteria that are normally present only in \\nsmall amounts increase in number, replace \\nnormal vaginal lactobacilli bacteria, and \\nupset the usual balance.

Preterm labor and birth are also \\npossibly more common in women with \\nbacterial vaginosis. \\n \\n \\nTrichomoniasis \\n \\nTrichomoniasis\\n12 (pronounced trik-uh-muh-\\nNAHY-uh-sis) infection is caused by the \\nsingle-celled protozoan parasite \\nTrichomonas vaginalis and is common in \\nyoung, sexually active women. The parasite \\nalso infects men, though less frequently. \\nThe parasite can be transmitted between \\nmen and women as well as between \\nwomen whenever physical contact occurs \\nbetween the genital areas. Although \\nTrichomonas infections do not always cause \\nsymptoms, they can cause frequent, \\npainful, or burning urination in men and \\nwomen as well as vaginal discharge, genital \\nsoreness, redness, or itching in women. \\nBecause the infection can occur without \\nsymptoms, a person may be unaware that \\nhe or she is infected and continue to re-\\ninfect a sexual partner who is having \\nrecurrent signs of infection. As with \\nbacterial STDs/STIs, all sexual partners \\nshould be treated at the same time to avoid \\nre-infection. \\n \\nNICHD-sponsored research has shown that \\nduring pregnancy, Trichomonas infection is \\nassociated with an increased risk of \\npremature birth and infants with low birth \\nweight. Moreover, infants born to mothers \\nwith Trichomonas infection are more than \\ntwice as likely as infants born to uninfected \\nwomen to be stillborn or to die as \\nnewborns.\\n13 \\n \\n \\nViral Hepatitis \\n \\nViral hepatitis is a serious liver disease that \\ncan be caused by several different viruses, \\nwhich can be transmitted through sexual \\ncontact. \\n \\n• Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes a \\nshort-term or self-limited liver \\ninfection that can be quite serious, \\nalthough it does not result in chronic \\ninfection.
